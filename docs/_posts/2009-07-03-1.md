MySQL 5.1.36 がリリースされました。<br>
これは MySQL 5.1 シリーズの最新バージョンです。<br>
<br>
このバージョンには、MyNAのメーリングリストで報告され、ML内の見事なやりとりによってパッチ提案まで進んだ、「sjis系文字に UPPER(), LOWER() を処理すると、2バイト文字であることを無視して変換してしまう（＝文字化けが発生する）」という問題への対応が含まれています。<br>

<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
- Lettercase conversion in multibyte cp932 or sjis<br>
  character sequences could produce incorrect results.<br>
  (Bug#44352: http://bugs.mysql.com/44352)<br>

■機能の追加と変更(5.1.36)：<br>
- Important Change: Replication: Previously, incident log<br>
  events were represented as comments in the output from<br>
  mysqlbinlog, making them effectively silent when playing<br>
  back the binlog.<br>
  (An incident log event represents an incident that could<br>
  cause the contents of the database to change without that<br>
  event being recorded in the binary log.)<br>
  This meant that, if the SQL were applied to a server, it<br>
  could potentially lead to the master and the slave having<br>
  different data.  To make it possible to handle incident<br>
  log events without breaking applications that expect the<br>
  previous behavior, the nonsense statement RELOAD DATABASE<br>
  is added to the SQL output for that incident log event,<br>
  which causes an error.<br>
  To use this functionality currently requires hand editing<br>
  of the dump file and handling of each case on an<br>
  individual basis by a database administrator before<br>
  applying the output to a server.<br>
  (Bug#44442: http://bugs.mysql.com/44442)<br>
<br>
- The time zone tables for Windows available at<br>
  timezones.html have been updated.<br>
  (Bug#39923: http://bugs.mysql.com/39923)<br>
<br>
- The mysqltest program now has a move_file from_file<br>
  to_file command for renaming files.  This should be used<br>
  in test cases rather than invoking an external command<br>
  that might be platform specific.<br>
  (Bug#39542: http://bugs.mysql.com/39542)<br>
<br>
<br>
■バグ修正(5.1.36)：<br>
- Incompatible Change: The server can load plugins under<br>
  the control of startup options.  For example, many storage<br>
  engines can be built in pluggable form and loaded when<br>
  the server starts.  In the following descriptions,<br>
  plugin_name stands for a plugin name such as innodb.<br>
  Previously, plugin options were handled like other<br>
  boolean options (see Section 4.2.3.2, "Program Option<br>
  Modifiers").  That is, any of these options enabled the<br>
  plugin:<br>
<br>
     --plugin_name<br>
     --plugin_name=1<br>
     --enable-plugin_name<br>
<br>
  And these options disabled the plugin:<br>
<br>
     --plugin_name=0<br>
     --disable-plugin_name<br>
     --skip-plugin_name<br>
<br>
  However, use of a boolean option for plugin loading did<br>
  not provide control over what to do if the plugin failed<br>
  to start properly: Should the server exit, or start with<br>
  the plugin disabled? The actual behavior has been that<br>
  the server starts with the plugin disabled, which can be<br>
  problematic.  For example, if InnoDB fails to start,<br>
  existing InnoDB tables become inaccessible, and attempts<br>
  to create new InnoDB tables result in tables that use the<br>
  default storage engine unless the NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION<br>
  SQL mode has been enabled to cause an error to occur<br>
  instead.<br>
  Now, there is a change in the options used to control<br>
  plugin loading, such that they have a tristate format:<br>
<br>
     + --plugin_name=OFF<br>
       Do not enable the plugin.<br>
<br>
     + --plugin_name[=ON]<br>
       Enable the plugin.  If plugin initialization fails,<br>
       start the server anyway, but with the plugin<br>
       disabled.  Specifying the option as --plugin_name<br>
       without a value also enables the plugin.<br>
<br>
     + --plugin_name=FORCE<br>
       Enable the plugin.  If plugin initialization fails,<br>
       do not start the server.  In other words, force the<br>
       server to run with the plugin or not at all.<br>
<br>
  The values OFF, ON, and FORCE are not case sensitive.<br>
  Suppose that CSV and InnoDB have been built as pluggable<br>
  storage engines and that you want the server to load them<br>
  at startup, subject to these conditions: The server is<br>
  allowed to run if CSV initialization fails, but must<br>
  require that InnoDB initialization succeed.  To accomplish<br>
  that, use these lines in an option file:<br>
<br>
     [mysqld]<br>
     csv=ON<br>
     innodb=FORCE<br>
<br>
  This change is incompatible with the previous<br>
  implementation if you used options of the form<br>
  --plugin_name=0 or --plugin_name=1, which should be<br>
  changed to --plugin_name=OFF or --plugin_name=ON,<br>
  respectively.<br>
  --enable-plugin_name is still supported and is the same<br>
  as --plugin_name=ON. --disable-plugin_name and<br>
  --skip-plugin_name are still supported and are the same<br>
  as --plugin_name=OFF.<br>
  (Bug#19027: http://bugs.mysql.com/19027)<br>
<br>
- Replication: When using row-based logging, the length of<br>
  an event for which the field metadata exceeded 255 bytes<br>
  in size was incorrectly calculated.  This could lead to<br>
  corruption of the binary log, or cause the server to<br>
  hang. (Bug#42749: http://bugs.mysql.com/42749)<br>
  See also Bug#44548: http://bugs.mysql.com/44548,<br>
  Bug#44672: http://bugs.mysql.com/44672,<br>
  Bug#44752: http://bugs.mysql.com/44752.<br>
<br>
- Replication: The warning Statement is not safe to log in<br>
  statement format, issued in situations when it cannot be<br>
  determined that a statement or other database event can<br>
  be written reliably to the binary log using the<br>
  statement-based format, has been changed to Statement may<br>
  not be safe to log in statement format.<br>
  (Bug#42415: http://bugs.mysql.com/42415)<br>
<br>
- Replication: When stopping and restarting the slave while<br>
  it was replicating temporary tables, the slave server<br>
  could crash or raise an assertion failure.  This was due<br>
  to the fact that, although temporary tables were saved<br>
  between slave thread restarts, the reference to the<br>
  thread being used (table->in_use) was not being properly<br>
  updated when restarting, continuing to reference the old<br>
  thread instead of the new one.  This issue affected<br>
  statement-based replication only.<br>

- Builds linked against OpenSSL had a memory leak in<br>
  association with use of X509 certificates.<br>

  innodb_commit_concurrency at runtime from zero to nonzero<br>
  or from nonzero to zero.  Now this variable cannot be<br>
  changed at runtime from zero to nonzero or vice versa.<br>
  The value can still be changed from one nonzero value to<br>
  another. (Bug#42101: http://bugs.mysql.com/42101)<br>
<br>
- SELECT ... INTO @var could produce values different from<br>
  SELECT ... without the INTO clause.<br>
