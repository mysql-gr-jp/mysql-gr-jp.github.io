--------------------------------<br>
以下チェンジログ(5.1.33)：<br>
■機能の追加と変更(5.1.33)：<br>
- mysql-test-run.pl now supports an --experimental=file_name<br>
  option. It enables you to specify a file that contains a list<br>
  of test cases that should be displayed with the [ exp-fail ]<br>
  code rather than [ fail ] if they fail.<br>
  (Bug#42888: http://bugs.mysql.com/42888)<br>
<br>
- The MD5 algorithm now uses the Xfree implementation.<br>
  (Bug#42434: http://bugs.mysql.com/42434)<br>
<br>
- The query cache now checks whether a SELECT statement begins<br>
  with SQL_NO_CACHE to determine whether it can skip checking<br>
  for the query result in the query cache. This is not supported<br>
  when SQL_NO_CACHE occurs within a comment.<br>
  (Bug#37416: http://bugs.mysql.com/37416)<br>
<br>
<br>
■バグ修正(5.1.33)：<br>
- Partitioning: A duplicate key error raised when inserting into<br>
  a partitioned table used a different error code from that<br>
  returned by such an error raised when inserting into a table<br>
  that was not partitioned.<br>
  (Bug#38719: http://bugs.mysql.com/38719)<br>
  See also Bug#28842: http://bugs.mysql.com/28842.<br>
<br>
- Partitioning: Several error messages relating to partitioned<br>
  tables were incorrect or missing.<br>
  (Bug#36001: http://bugs.mysql.com/36001)<br>
<br>
- Replication: When --binlog_format was set to STATEMENT, a<br>
  statement unsafe for statement-based logging caused an error<br>
  or warning to be issued even if sql_log_bin was set to 0.<br>
  (Bug#41980: http://bugs.mysql.com/41980)<br>
<br>
- Replication: When using MIXED replication format and temporary<br>
  tables were created in statement-based mode, but a later<br>
  operation in the same session caused a switch to row-based<br>
  mode, the temporary tables were not dropped on the slave at<br>
  the end of the session.<br>
  (Bug#40013: http://bugs.mysql.com/40013)<br>
  See also Bug#43046: http://bugs.mysql.com/43046.<br>
  This regression was introduced by<br>
  Bug#20499: http://bugs.mysql.com/20499.<br>
<br>
- Replication: When using the MIXED replication format, UPDATE<br>
  and DELETE statements that searched for rows where part of the<br>
  key had nullable BIT columns failed. This occurred because<br>
  operations that inserted the data were replicated as<br>
  statements, but UPDATE and DELETE statements affecting the<br>
  same data were replicated using row-based format.<br>
  This issue did not occur when using statement-based<br>
  replication (only) or row-based replication (only).<br>
  (Bug#39753: http://bugs.mysql.com/39753)<br>
  See also Bug#39648: http://bugs.mysql.com/39648.<br>
<br>
- Replication: The server SQL mode in effect when a stored<br>
  procedure was created was not retained in the binary log. This<br>
  could cause a CREATE PROCEDURE statement that succeeded on the<br>
  master to fail on the slave.<br>
  This issue was first noticed when a stored procedure was<br>
  created when ANSI_QUOTES was in effect on the master, but<br>
  could possibly cause failed CREATE PROCEDURE statements and<br>
  other problems on the slave when using other server SQL modes<br>
  as well. (Bug#39526: http://bugs.mysql.com/39526)<br>
<br>
- Replication: If --secure-file-priv was set on the slave, it<br>
  was unable to execute LOAD DATA INFILE statements sent from<br>
  the master when using mixed-format or statement-based<br>
  replication.<br>
  As a result of this fix, this security restriction is now<br>
  ignored on the slave in such cases; instead the slave checks<br>
  whether the files were created and should be read by the slave<br>
  in its --slave-load-tmpdir.<br>
  (Bug#38174: http://bugs.mysql.com/38174)<br>
<br>
- Replication: Server IDs greater than 2147483647 (2^32 - 1)<br>
  were represented by negative numbers in the binary log.<br>
  (Bug#37313: http://bugs.mysql.com/37313)<br>
<br>
- Replication: When its disk becomes full, a replication slave<br>
  may wait while writing the binary log, relay log or MyISAM<br>
  tables, continuing after space has been made available. The<br>
  error message provided in such cases was not clear about the<br>
  frequency with which checking for free space is done (once<br>
  every 60 seconds), and how long the server waits after space<br>
  has been freed before continuing (also 60 seconds); this<br>
  caused users to think that the server had hung.<br>
  These issues have been addressed by making the error message<br>
  clearer, and dividing it into two separate messages:<br>
<br>
    1. The error message Disk is full writing 'filename'<br>
       (Errcode: error_code). Waiting for someone to free<br>
       space... (Expect up to 60 secs delay for server to<br>
       continue after freeing disk space) is printed only once.<br>
<br>
    2. The warning Retry in 60 secs, Message reprinted in 600<br>
       secs is printed once every for every 10 times that the<br>
       check for free space is made; that is, the check is<br>
       performed once each 60 seconds, but the reminder that<br>
       space needs to be freed is printed only once every 10<br>
       minutes (600 seconds).<br>
  (Bug#22082: http://bugs.mysql.com/22082)<br>
<br>
- Replication: The statements DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS and DROP<br>
  FUNCTION IF EXISTS were not written to the binary log if the<br>
  procedure or function to be dropped did not exist.<br>
  (Bug#13684: http://bugs.mysql.com/13684)<br>
  See also Bug#25705: http://bugs.mysql.com/25705.<br>
<br>
- Use of USE INDEX hints could cause EXPLAIN EXTENDED to crash.<br>
  (Bug#43354: http://bugs.mysql.com/43354)<br>
<br>
- For InnoDB tables, overflow in an AUTO_INCREMENT column could<br>
  cause a server crash. (Bug#43203: http://bugs.mysql.com/43203)<br>
<br>
- On 32-bit Windows, mysqld could not use large buffers due to a<br>
  2GB user mode address limit.<br>
  (Bug#43082: http://bugs.mysql.com/43082)<br>
<br>
- stderr should be unbuffered, but when the server redirected<br>
  stderr to a file, it became buffered.<br>
  (Bug#42790: http://bugs.mysql.com/42790)<br>
<br>
- The DATA_TYPE column of the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS table<br>
  displayed the UNSIGNED attribute for floating-point data<br>
  types. (The column should contain only the data type name.)<br>
  (Bug#42758: http://bugs.mysql.com/42758)<br>
<br>
- For InnoDB tables, spurious duplicate-key errors could occur<br>
  when inserting into an AUTO_INCREMENT column.<br>
  (Bug#42714: http://bugs.mysql.com/42714)<br>
<br>
- mysqldump included views that were excluded with the<br>
  --ignore-table option.<br>
  (Bug#42635: http://bugs.mysql.com/42635)<br>
<br>
- An earlier bug fix resulted in the problem that the InnoDB<br>
  plugin could not be used with a server that was compiled with<br>
  the built-in InnoDB. To handle this two changes were made:<br>
<br>
     + The server now supports an --ignore-builtin-innodb option<br>
       that causes the server to behave as if the built-in<br>
       InnoDB is not present. This option causes other InnoDB<br>
       options not to be recognized.<br>
<br>
     + For the INSTALL PLUGIN statement, the server reads option<br>
       (my.cnf) files just as during server startup. This<br>
       enables the plugin to pick up any relevant options from<br>
       those files. Consequently, a plugin no longer is started<br>
       with each option set to its default value.<br>
       Because of this change, it is possible to add plugin<br>
       options to an option file even before loading a plugin<br>
       (if the loose prefix is used). It is also possible to<br>
       uninstall a plugin, edit my.cnf, and install the plugin<br>
       again. Restarting the plugin this way enables it to the<br>
       new option values without a server restart.<br>
<br>
  To take advantage of this bug fix, InnoDB Plugin 1.0.4 or<br>
  higher is required.  (Bug#42610: http://bugs.mysql.com/42610)<br>
  This regression was introduced by<br>
  Bug#29263: http://bugs.mysql.com/29263.<br>
<br>
- With the ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY SQL mode enabled, some legal<br>
  queries failed. (Bug#42567: http://bugs.mysql.com/42567)<br>
<br>
- Tables could enter open table cache for a thread without being<br>
  properly cleaned up, leading to a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#42419: http://bugs.mysql.com/42419)<br>
<br>
- For InnoDB tables, inserting into floating-point<br>
  AUTO_INCREMENT columns failed.<br>
  (Bug#42400: http://bugs.mysql.com/42400)<br>
<br>
- The InnoDB btr_search_drop_page_hash_when_freed() function had<br>
  a race condition. (Bug#42279: http://bugs.mysql.com/42279)<br>
<br>
- Parsing of the optional microsecond component of DATETIME<br>
  values did not fail gracefully when that component width was<br>
  larger than the allowed six places.<br>
  (Bug#42146: http://bugs.mysql.com/42146)<br>
<br>
- mysqldumpslow parsed the --debug and --verbose options<br>
  incorrectly. (Bug#42027: http://bugs.mysql.com/42027)<br>
<br>
- Queries that used the loose index scan access method could<br>
  return no rows. (Bug#41610: http://bugs.mysql.com/41610)<br>
<br>
- The error message for a too-long column comment was Unknown<br>
  error rather than a more appropriate message.<br>
  (Bug#41465: http://bugs.mysql.com/41465)<br>
<br>
- Use of SELECT * allowed users with rights to only some columns<br>
  of a view to access all columns.<br>
  (Bug#41354: http://bugs.mysql.com/41354)<br>
<br>
- The server did not robustly handle problems hang if a table<br>
  opened with HANDLER needed to be re-opened because it had been<br>
  altered to use a different storage engine that does not<br>
  support HANDLER. The server also failed to set an error if the<br>
  re-open attempt failed. These problems could cause the server<br>
  to crash or hang. (Bug#41110: http://bugs.mysql.com/41110,<br>
  Bug#41112: http://bugs.mysql.com/41112)<br>
<br>
- SELECT statements executed concurrently with INSERT statements<br>
  for a MyISAM table could cause incorrect results to be<br>
  returned from the query cache.<br>
  (Bug#41098: http://bugs.mysql.com/41098)<br>
<br>
- For prepared statements, multibyte character sets were not<br>
  taking into account when calculating max_length for string<br>
  values and mysql_stmt_fetch() could return truncated strings.<br>
  (Bug#41078: http://bugs.mysql.com/41078)<br>
<br>
- Deprecation warnings that referred to MySQL 5.2 were changed<br>
  to refer to MySQL 6.0.<br>
  (Bug#41077: http://bugs.mysql.com/41077)<br>
<br>
- For user-defined variables in a query result, incorrect length<br>
  values were returned in the result metadata.<br>
  (Bug#41030: http://bugs.mysql.com/41030)<br>
<br>
- On Windows, starting the server with an invalid value for<br>
  innodb_flush_method caused a crash.<br>
  (Bug#40757: http://bugs.mysql.com/40757)<br>
<br>
- MySQL 5.1 crashed with index merge algorithm and merge tables.<br>
  A query in the MyISAM merge table caused a crash if the index<br>
  merge algorithm was being used.<br>
  (Bug#40675: http://bugs.mysql.com/40675)<br>
<br>
- With strict SQL mode enabled, setting a system variable to an<br>
  out-of-bounds value caused an assertion failure.<br>
  (Bug#40657: http://bugs.mysql.com/40657)<br>
<br>
- Table temporary scans were slower than necessary due to use of<br>
  mmap rather than caching, even with the myisam_use_mmap system<br>
  variable disabled. (Bug#40634: http://bugs.mysql.com/40634)<br>
<br>
- For a view that references a table in another database,<br>
  mysqldump wrote the view name qualified with the current<br>
  database name. This makes it impossible to reload the dump<br>
  file into a different database.<br>
  (Bug#40345: http://bugs.mysql.com/40345)<br>
<br>
- On platforms where long and pointer variables have different<br>
  sizes, MyISAM could copy key statistics incorrectly, resulting<br>
  in a server crash or incorrect cardinality values.<br>
  (Bug#40321: http://bugs.mysql.com/40321)<br>
<br>
- DELETE tried to acquire write (not read) locks for tables<br>
  accessed within a subquery of the WHERE clause.<br>
  (Bug#39843: http://bugs.mysql.com/39843)<br>
<br>
- perror did not produce correct output for error codes 153 to<br>
  163. (Bug#39370: http://bugs.mysql.com/39370)<br>
<br>
- Several functions in libmysqld called exit() when an error<br>
  occurred rather than returning an error to the caller.<br>
  (Bug#39289: http://bugs.mysql.com/39289)<br>
<br>
- The innodb_log_arch_dir system variable is no longer available<br>
  but was present in some of the sample option files included<br>
  with MySQL distributions (such as my-huge.cnf). The line was<br>
  present as a comment but uncommenting it would cause server<br>
  startup failure so the line has been removed.<br>
  (Bug#38249: http://bugs.mysql.com/38249)<br>
<br>
- --help output for myisamchk did not list the --HELP option.<br>
  (Bug#38103: http://bugs.mysql.com/38103)<br>
<br>
- Comparisons between row constructors, such as (a, b) = (c, d)<br>
  resulted in unnecessary Illegal mix of collations errors for<br>
  string columns. (Bug#37601: http://bugs.mysql.com/37601)<br>
<br>
- If a user created a view that referenced tables for which the<br>
  user had disjoint privileges, an assertion failure occurred.<br>
  (Bug#37191: http://bugs.mysql.com/37191)<br>
<br>
- An argument to the MATCH() function that was an alias for an<br>
  expression other than a column name caused a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#36737: http://bugs.mysql.com/36737)<br>
<br>
- The event, general_log, and slow_log tables in the mysql<br>
  database store server_id values, but did not use an UNSIGNED<br>
  column and thus were not able to store the full range of ID<br>
  values. (Bug#36540: http://bugs.mysql.com/36540)<br>
<br>
- On Windows, the _PC macro in my_global.h was causing problems<br>
  for modern compilers. It has been removed because it is no<br>
  longer used. (Bug#34309: http://bugs.mysql.com/34309)<br>
<br>
- For DROP FUNCTION with names that were qualified with a<br>
  database name, the database name was handled in case-sensitive<br>
  fashion even with lower_case_table_names set to 1.<br>
  (Bug#33813: http://bugs.mysql.com/33813)<br>
<br>
- mysqldump --compatible=mysql40 emitted statements referring to<br>
  the character_set_client system variable, which is unknown<br>
  before MySQL 4.1. Now the statements are enclosed in<br>
  version-specific comments.<br>
  (Bug#33550: http://bugs.mysql.com/33550)<br>
<br>
- Use of MBR spatial functions such as MBRTouches() with columns<br>
  of InnoDB tables caused a server crash rather than an error.<br>
  (Bug#31435: http://bugs.mysql.com/31435)<br>
<br>
- The mysql client mishandled input parsing if a delimiter<br>
  command was not first on the line.<br>
  (Bug#31060: http://bugs.mysql.com/31060)<br>
<br>
- SHOW PRIVILEGES listed the CREATE ROUTINE privilege as having<br>
  a context of Functions,Procedures, but it is a database-level<br>
  privilege. (Bug#30305: http://bugs.mysql.com/30305)<br>
<br>
- mysqld --help did not work as root.<br>
  (Bug#30261: http://bugs.mysql.com/30261)<br>
<br>
- CHECK TABLE, REPAIR TABLE, ANALYZE TABLE, and OPTIMIZE TABLE<br>
  erroneously reported a table to be corrupt if the table did<br>
  not exist or the statement was terminated with KILL.<br>
  (Bug#29458: http://bugs.mysql.com/29458)<br>
<br>
- SHOW TABLE STATUS could fail to produce output for tables with<br>
  non-ASCII characters in their name.<br>
  (Bug#25830: http://bugs.mysql.com/25830)<br>
<br>
- Allocation of stack space for error messages could be too<br>
  small on HP-UX, leading to stack overflow crashes.<br>
  (Bug#21476: http://bugs.mysql.com/21476)<br>
<br>
- Floating-point numbers could be handled with different numbers<br>
  of digits depending on whether the text or prepared-statement<br>
  protocol was used. (Bug#21205: http://bugs.mysql.com/21205)<br>
<br>
- ROUND() sometimes returned different results on different<br>
  platforms. (Bug#15936: http://bugs.mysql.com/15936)<br>
