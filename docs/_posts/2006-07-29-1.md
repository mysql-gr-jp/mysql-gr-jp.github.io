MySQL 4.1 シリーズの最新バージョンとなる、 バージョン 4.1.21 がリリースされました。<br>
<br>
<br>
http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/4.1.html<br>
<br>
<br>
以下チェンジログ：<br>
■機能の追加と変更:<br>
<br>
- For spatial data types, the server formerly returned these as VARSTRING values with a binary collation. Now the server returns spatial values as BLOB values. (Bug#10166: http://bugs.mysql.com/10166)<br>
<br>
- Added the --set-charset option to mysqlbinlog to allow the character set to be specified for processing binary log files. (Bug#18351: http://bugs.mysql.com/18351)<br>
<br>
- For a table with an AUTO_INCREMENT column, SHOW CREATE TABLE now shows the next AUTO_INCREMENT value to be generated. (Bug#19025: http://bugs.mysql.com/19025)<br>
<br>
- The mysqldumpslow script has been moved from client RPM packages to server RPM packages. This corrects a problem where mysqldumpslow could not be used with a client-only RPM install, because it depends on my_print_defaults which is in the server RPM. (Bug#20216: http://bugs.mysql.com/20216)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
■バグ修正:<br>
- Security fix: If a user has access to MyISAM table t, that user can create a MERGE table m that accesses t. However, if the user's privileges on t are subsequently revoked, the user can continue to access t by doing so through m. If this behavior is undesirable, you can start the server with the new --skip-merge option to disable the MERGE storage engine. (Bug#15195: http://bugs.mysql.com/15195)<br>
<br>
- Security fix: Invalid arguments to DATE_FORMAT() caused a server crash. (CVE-2006-3469 (http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3469), Bug#20729: http://bugs.mysql.com/20729) Thanks to Jean-David Maillefer for discovering and reporting this problem to the Debian project and to Christian Hammers from the Debian Team for notifying us of it.<br>
<br>
- Failure to account for a NULL table pointer on big-endian machines could cause a server crash during type conversion. (Bug#21135: http://bugs.mysql.com/21135)<br>
<br>
- Some memory leaks in the libmysqld embedded server were corrected. (Bug#16107: http://bugs.mysql.com/16107)<br>
<br>
- When mysqldump disabled keys and locked a MyISAM table, the lock operation happened second. If another client performed a query on the table in the interim, it could take a long time due to indexes not being used. Now the lock operation happens first. (Bug#15977: http://bugs.mysql.com/15977)<br>
<br>
- The length of the pattern string prefix for LIKE operations was calculated incorrectly for multi-byte character sets. As a result, the the scanned range was wider than necessary if the prefix contained any multi-byte characters. (Bug#16674: http://bugs.mysql.com/16674, Bug#18359: http://bugs.mysql.com/18359)<br>
<br>
- For very complex SELECT statements could create temporary tables that were too big, but for which the temporary files did not get removed, causing subsequent queries to fail. (Bug#11824: http://bugs.mysql.com/11824)<br>
<br>
- Using SELECT and a table join while running a concurrent INSERT operation would join incorrect rows. (Bug#14400: http://bugs.mysql.com/14400)<br>
<br>
- Using SELECT on a corrupt table using the dynamic record format could cause a server crash. (Bug#19835: http://bugs.mysql.com/19835)<br>
<br>
- Checking a spatial table (using CHECK TABLE) with an index and only one row would indicate a table corruption. (Bug#17877: http://bugs.mysql.com/17877)<br>
<br>
- For SELECT ... FOR UPDATE statements that used DISTINCT or GROUP BY over all key parts of a unique index (or primary key), the optimizer unnecessarily created a temporary table, thus losing the linkage to the underlying unique index values. This caused a Result set not updatable error. (The temporary table is unnecessary because under these circumstances the distinct or grouped columns must also be unique.) (Bug#16458: http://bugs.mysql.com/16458)<br>
<br>
- Concatenating the results of multiple constant subselects produced incorrect results. (Bug#16716: http://bugs.mysql.com/16716)<br>
<br>
- The use of MIN() and MAX() on columns with a partial index produced incorrect results in some queries. (Bug#18206: http://bugs.mysql.com/18206)<br>
<br>
- Use of MIN() or MAX() with GROUP BY on a ucs2 column could cause a server crash. (Bug#20076: http://bugs.mysql.com/20076)<br>
<br>
- INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... LIMIT 1 could be slow because the LIMIT was ignored when selecting candidate rows. (Bug#9676: http://bugs.mysql.com/9676)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: When attempting to restart the cluster following a data import, the cluster would fail during Phase 4 of the restart with Error 2334: Job buffer congestion. (Bug#20774: http://bugs.mysql.com/20774)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: A node failure during a scan could sometime cause the node to crash when restarting too quickly following the failure. (Bug#20197: http://bugs.mysql.com/20197)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: It was possible to use port numbers greater than 65535 for ServerPort in the config.ini file. (Bug#19164: http://bugs.mysql.com/19164)<br>
<br>
- The omission of leading zeros in dates could lead to erroneous results when these were compared with the output of certain date and time functions. (Bug#16377: http://bugs.mysql.com/16377)<br>
<br>
- Certain queries having a WHERE clause that included conditions on multi-part keys with more than 2 key parts could produce incorrect results and send [Note] Use_count: Wrong count for key at... messages to STDERR. (Bug#16168: http://bugs.mysql.com/16168)<br>
<br>
- An invalid comparison between keys in partial indexes over multi-byte character fields could lead to incorrect result sets if the selected query execution plan used a range scan by a partial index over a UTF8 character field. This also caused incorrect results under similar circumstances with many other character sets. (Bug#14896: http://bugs.mysql.com/14896)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: The cluster's data nodes would fail while trying to load data when NoOfFrangmentLogFiles was equal to 1. (Bug#19894: http://bugs.mysql.com/19894)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: A problem with error handling when ndb_use_exact_count was enabled could lead to incorrect values returned from queries using COUNT(). A warning is now returned in such cases. (Bug#19202: http://bugs.mysql.com/19202)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: LOAD DATA LOCAL failed to ignore duplicate keys in Cluster tables. (Bug#19496: http://bugs.mysql.com/19496)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Repeated CREATE - INSERT - DROP operations tables could in some circumstances cause the MySQL table definition cache to become corrupt, so that some mysqld processes could access table information but others could not. (Bug#18595: http://bugs.mysql.com/18595)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: The mgm client command ALL CLUSTERLOG STATISTICS=15; had no effect. (Bug#20336: http://bugs.mysql.com/20336)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: TRUNCATE TABLE failed to reset the AUTO_INCREMENT counter. (Bug#18864: http://bugs.mysql.com/18864)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: SELECT ... FOR UPDATE failed to lock the selected rows. (Bug#18184: http://bugs.mysql.com/18184)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: The failure of a data node when preparing to commit a transaction (that is, while the node's status was CS_PREPARE_TO_COMMIT) could cause the failure of other cluster data nodes. (Bug#20185: http://bugs.mysql.com/20185)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Renaming a table in such a way as to move it to to a different database failed to move the table's indexes. (Bug#19967: http://bugs.mysql.com/19967)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Resources for unique indexes on Cluster table columns were incorrectly allocated, so that only one-fourth as many unique indexes as indicated by the value of UniqueHashIndexes could be created. (Bug#19623: http://bugs.mysql.com/19623)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster (NDBAPI): On big-endian platforms, NdbOperation::write_attr() did not update 32-bit fields correctly. (Bug#19537: http://bugs.mysql.com/19537)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Some queries having a WHERE clause of the form c1=val1 OR c2 LIKE 'val2' were not evaluated correctly. (Bug # 17421)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Using "stale" mysqld .FRM files could cause a newly-restored cluster to fail. This situation could arise when restarting a MySQL Cluster using the --intial option while leaving connected mysqld processes running. (Bug#16875: http://bugs.mysql.com/16875)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Repeated use of the SHOW and ALL STATUS commands in the ndb_mgm client could cause the mgmd process to crash. (Bug#18591: http://bugs.mysql.com/18591)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: An issue with ndb_mgmd prevented more than 27 mysqld processes from connecting to a single cluster at one time. (Bug#17150: http://bugs.mysql.com/17150)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Data node failures could cause excessive CPU usage by ndb_mgmd. (Bug#13987: http://bugs.mysql.com/13987)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: TRUNCATE failed on tables having BLOB or TEXT columns with the error Lock wait timeout exceeded. (Bug#19201: http://bugs.mysql.com/19201)<br>
<br>
- A cast problem caused incorrect results for prepared statements that returned float values when MySQL was compiled with gcc 4.0. (Bug#19694: http://bugs.mysql.com/19694)<br>
<br>
- Improper character set initialization in the embedded server could result in a server crash. (Bug#20318: http://bugs.mysql.com/20318)<br>
<br>
- Some queries that used ORDER BY and LIMIT performed quickly in MySQL 3.23, but slowly in MySQL 4.x/5.x due to an optimizer problem. (Bug#4981: http://bugs.mysql.com/4981)<br>
<br>
- Queries using an indexed column as the argument for the MIN() and MAX() functions following an ALTER TABLE .. DISABLE KEYS statement returned Got error 124 from storage engine until ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE KEYS was run on the table. (Bug#20357: http://bugs.mysql.com/20357)<br>
<br>
- A number of dependency issues in the RPM bench and test packages caused installation of these packages to fail. (Bug#20078: http://bugs.mysql.com/20078)<br>
<br>
- The MD5() and SHA() functions treat their arguments as case-sensitive strings. But when they are compared, their arguments were compared as case-insensitive strings, which leads to two function calls with different arguments (and thus different results) compared as being identical. This can lead to a wrong decision made in the range optimizer and thus to an incorrect result set. (Bug#15351: http://bugs.mysql.com/15351)<br>
<br>
- InnoDB unlocked its data directory before committing a transaction, potentially resulting in non-recoverable tables if a server crash occurred before the commit. (Bug#19727: http://bugs.mysql.com/19727)<br>
<br>
- Multiple-table DELETE statements containing a subquery that selected from one of the tables being modified caused a server crash. (Bug#19225: http://bugs.mysql.com/19225)<br>
<br>
- The ARCHIVE storage engine does not support TRUNCATE TABLE, but the server was not returning an appropriate error when truncation of an ARCHIVE table was attempted. (Bug#15558: http://bugs.mysql.com/15558)<br>
<br>
- An update that used a join of a table to itself and modified the table on both sides of the join reported the table as crashed. (Bug#18036: http://bugs.mysql.com/18036)<br>
<br>
- The fill_help_tables.sql file did not load properly if the ANSI_QUOTES SQL mode was enabled. (Bug#20542: http://bugs.mysql.com/20542)<br>
<br>
- The fill_help_tables.sql file did not contain a SET NAMES 'utf8' statement to indicate its encoding. This caused problems for some settings of the MySQL character set such as big5. (Bug#20551: http://bugs.mysql.com/20551)<br>
<br>
- The MySQL server startup script /etc/init.d/mysql (created from mysql.server) is now marked to ensure that the system services ypbind, nscd, ldap, and NTP are started first (if these are configured on the machine). (Bug#18810: http://bugs.mysql.com/18810)<br>
<br>
- For a reference to a non-existent index in FORCE INDEX, the error message referred to a column, not an index. (Bug#17873: http://bugs.mysql.com/17873)<br>
<br>
- In a multiple-row INSERT statement, LAST_INSERT_ID() should return the same value for each row. However, in some cases, the value could change if the table being inserted into had its own AUTO_INCREMENT column. (Bug#6880: http://bugs.mysql.com/6880)<br>
<br>
- Invalid escape sequences in option files caused MySQL programs that read them to abort. (Bug#15328: http://bugs.mysql.com/15328)<br>
<br>
- Binary log lacked character set information for table name when dropping temporary tables. (Bug#14157: http://bugs.mysql.com/14157)<br>
<br>
- InnoDB did not increment the handler_read_prev counter. (Bug#19542: http://bugs.mysql.com/19542)<br>
<br>
- Slave SQL thread cleanup was not handled properly on Mac OS X when a statement was killed, resulting in a slave crash. (Bug#16900: http://bugs.mysql.com/16900)<br>
<br>
- mysqldump did not respect the order of tables named with the --tables option. (Bug#18536: http://bugs.mysql.com/18536)<br>
<br>
- The server no longer uses a signal handler for signal 0 because it could cause a crash on some platforms. (Bug#15869: http://bugs.mysql.com/15869)<br>
<br>
- LOAD_FILE() returned an error if the file did not exist, rather than NULL as it should according to the manual. (Bug#10418: http://bugs.mysql.com/10418)<br>
<br>
- Use of uninitialized user variables in a subquery in the FROM clause results in bad entries in the binary log. (Bug#19136: http://bugs.mysql.com/19136)<br>
<br>
- IS_USED_LOCK() could return an incorrect connection identifier. (Bug#16501: http://bugs.mysql.com/16501)<br>
<br>
- Concurrent reading and writing of privilege structures could crash the server. (Bug#16372: http://bugs.mysql.com/16372)<br>
<br>
- A statement containing GROUP BY and HAVING clauses could return incorrect results when the HAVING clause contained logic that returned FALSE for every row. (Bug#14927: http://bugs.mysql.com/14927)<br>
<br>
- MONTHNAME(STR_TO_DATE(NULL, '%m')) could cause a server crash. (Bug#18501: http://bugs.mysql.com/18501)<br>
<br>
- The ref optimizer could choose the ref_or_null access method in cases where it was not applicable. This could cause inconsistent EXPLAIN or SELECT results for a given statement. (Bug#16798: http://bugs.mysql.com/16798)<br>
<br>
- ANALYZE TABLE for TEMPORARY tables had no effect. (Bug#15225: http://bugs.mysql.com/15225)<br>
<br>
- When myisamchk needed to rebuild a table, AUTO_INCREMENT information was lost. (Bug#10405: http://bugs.mysql.com/10405)<br>
<br>
- No error message was being issued for storage engines that do not support ALTER TABLE. Now an ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_YET error occurs. (Bug#7643: http://bugs.mysql.com/7643)<br>
<br>
- The binary log would create an incorrect DROP query when creating temporary tables during replication. (Bug#17263: http://bugs.mysql.com/17263)<br>
