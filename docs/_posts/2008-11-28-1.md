以下、チェンジログ：<br>
■バグ修正(5.1.30GA)<br>
- Partitioning: A SELECT using a range WHERE condition with an<br>
  ORDER BY on a partitioned table caused a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#40494: http://bugs.mysql.com/40494)<br>
<br>
- Partitioning: Dropping or creating an index on a partitioned<br>
  table managed by the InnoDB Plugin locked the table.<br>
  (Bug#37453: http://bugs.mysql.com/37453)<br>
<br>
- Replication: Row-based replication failed with non-partitioned<br>
  MyISAM tables having no indexes.<br>
  (Bug#40004: http://bugs.mysql.com/40004)<br>
<br>
- With statement-based binary logging format and a transaction<br>
  isolation level of READ COMMITTED or stricter, InnoDB printed<br>
  an error because statement-based logging might lead to<br>
  inconsistency between master and slave databases. However,<br>
  this error was printed even when binary logging was not<br>
  enabled (in which case, no such inconsistency can occur).<br>
  (Bug#40360: http://bugs.mysql.com/40360)<br>
<br>
- The CHECK TABLE ... FOR UPGRADE statement did not check for<br>
  incompatible collation changes made in MySQL 5.1.24. (This<br>
  also affects mysqlcheck and mysql_upgrade, which cause that<br>
  statement to be executed.)<br>
  Prior to this fix, a binary upgrade (performed without dumping<br>
  tables with mysqldump before the upgrade and reloading the<br>
  dump file after the upgrade) would corrupt tables. After the<br>
  fix, CHECK TABLE ... FOR UPGRADE properly detects the problem<br>
  and upgrades tables.<br>
  However, the fix is not backward compatible and can result in<br>
  a downgrading problem under these circumstances:<br>
<br>
    1. Perform a binary upgrade to a version of MySQL that<br>
       includes the fix.<br>
<br>
    2. Run CHECK TABLE ... FOR UPGRADE (or mysqlcheck or<br>
       mysql_upgrade) to upgrade tables.<br>
<br>
    3. Perform a binary downgrade to a version of MySQL that<br>
       does not include the fix.<br>
<br>
  The solution is to dump tables with mysqldump before the<br>
  downgrade and reload the dump file after the downgrade.<br>
  Alternatively, drop and recreate affected indexes.<br>
  (Bug#40053: http://bugs.mysql.com/40053)<br>
<br>
- Some recent releases for Solaris 10 were built on Solaris 10<br>
  U5, which included a new version of libnsl.so that does not<br>
  work on U4 or earlier. To correct this, Solaris 10 builds now<br>
  are created on machines that do not have that upgraded<br>
  libnsl.so, so that they will work on Solaris 10 installations<br>
  both with and without the upgraded libnsl.so.<br>
  (Bug#39074: http://bugs.mysql.com/39074)<br>
<br>
- XA transaction rollbacks could result in corrupted transaction<br>
  states and a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#28323: http://bugs.mysql.com/28323)<br>
<br>
- ALTER TABLE for an ENUM column could change column values.<br>
  (Bug#23113: http://bugs.mysql.com/23113)<br>
