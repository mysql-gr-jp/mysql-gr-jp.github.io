以下、チェンジログ：<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
■InnoDB Plugin 情報：<br>
<br>
      * This release includes InnoDB Plugin 1.0.6. This version is<br>
        considered of Release Candidate (RC) quality.<br>
        In this release, the InnoDB Plugin is included in source and<br>
        binary distributions, except RHEL3, RHEL4, SuSE 9 (x86,<br>
        x86_64, ia64), and generic Linux RPM packages. It also does<br>
        not work for FreeBSD 6 and HP-UX or for Linux on generic ia64.<br>
<br>
■機能の追加と変更：<br>
<br>
      * mysqltest has a new --max-connections option to set a higher<br>
        number of maximum allowed server connections than the default<br>
        128. This option can also be passed via mysql-test-run.pl.<br>
        (Bug#51135: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=51135)<br>
<br>
      * mysql-test-run.pl has a new --portbase option and a<br>
        corresponding MTR_PORT_BASE environment variable for setting<br>
        the port range, as an alternative to the existing<br>
        --build-thread option.<br>
        (Bug#50182: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50182)<br>
<br>
      * mysql-test-run.pl has a new --gprof option that runs the<br>
        server through the gprof profiler, much the same way the<br>
        currently supported --gcov option runs it through gcov.<br>
        (Bug#49345: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49345)<br>
<br>
      * mysqltest has a new lowercase_result command that converts the<br>
        output of the next statement to lowercase. This is useful for<br>
        test cases where the lettercase may vary between platforms.<br>
        (Bug#48863: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48863)<br>
<br>
      * mysqltest has a new remove_files_wildcard command that removes<br>
        files matching a pattern from a directory.<br>
        (Bug#39774: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=39774)<br>
<br>
■バグ修正：<br>
      * Partitioning: Attempting to drop a partitioned table from one<br>
        connection while waiting for the completion of an ALTER TABLE<br>
        that had been issued from a different connection, and that<br>
        changed the storage engine used by the table, could cause the<br>
        server to crash.<br>
        (Bug#42438: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=42438)<br>
<br>
      * Replication: Adding an index to a table on the master caused<br>
        the slave to stop logging slow queries to the slow query log.<br>
        (Bug#50620: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50620)<br>
<br>
      * Replication: Queries which were written to the slow query log<br>
        on the master were not written to the slow query log on the<br>
        slave. (Bug#23300: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=23300)<br>
        See also Bug#48632: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48632.<br>
<br>
      * mysqld_multi failed due to a syntax error in the script.<br>
        (Bug#51468: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=51468)<br>
<br>
      * Referring to a subquery result in a HAVING clause could<br>
        produce incorrect results.<br>
        (Bug#50995: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50995)<br>
<br>
      * Use of filesort plus the join cache normally is preferred to a<br>
        full index scan. But it was used even if the index is<br>
        clustered, in which case, the clustered index scan can be<br>
        faster. (Bug#50843: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50843)<br>
<br>
      * For debug builds, SHOW BINARY LOGS caused an assertion to be<br>
        raised if binary logging was not enabled.<br>
        (Bug#50780: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50780)<br>
<br>
      * Incorrect handling of BIT columns in temporary tables could<br>
        lead to spurious duplicate-key errors.<br>
        (Bug#50591: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50591)<br>
<br>
      * Full-text queries that used the truncation operator (*) could<br>
        enter an infinite loop.<br>
        (Bug#50351: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50351)<br>
<br>
      * mysqltest no longer lets you execute an SQL statement on a<br>
        connection after doing a send command, unless you do a reap<br>
        first. This was previously accepted but could produce<br>
        unpredictable results.<br>
        (Bug#49269: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49269)<br>
<br>
      * For debug builds on Windows, warnings about incorrect use of<br>
        debugging directives were written to the error log. The<br>
        directives were rewritten to eliminate these messages.<br>
        (Bug#49025: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49025)<br>
<br>
      * Building MySQL on Fedora Core 12 64-bit failed, due to errors<br>
        in comp_err.<br>
        (Bug#48864: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48864)<br>
<br>
      * An ARZ file missing from the database directory caused the<br>
        server to crash.<br>
        (Bug#48757: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48757)<br>
<br>
      * Slow CALL statements were not always logged to the slow query<br>
        log because execution time for multiple-statement stored<br>
        procedures was assessed incorrectly.<br>
        (Bug#47905: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47905)<br>
<br>
      * Failure to open a view with a nonexistent DEFINER was<br>
        improperly handled and the server would crash later attempting<br>
        to lock the view.<br>
        (Bug#47734: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47734)<br>
<br>
      * If EXPLAIN encountered an error in the query, a memory leak<br>
        occurred. (Bug#45989: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=45989)<br>
<br>
      * Grouping by a subquery in a query with a DISTINCT aggregate<br>
        function led to incorrect and unordered grouping values.<br>
        (Bug#45640: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=45640)<br>
<br>
      * Propagation of a large unsigned numeric constant in WHERE<br>
        expressions could lead to incorrect results. This also<br>
        affected EXPLAIN EXTENDED, which printed incorrect numeric<br>
        constants in such transformed WHERE expressions.<br>
        (Bug#45360: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=45360)<br>
<br>
      * Valgrind warnings about uninitialized variables in optimizer<br>
        code were silenced.<br>
        (Bug#45195: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=45195)<br>
<br>
      * flush_cache_records() did not correctly check for errors that<br>
        should cause statement execution to stop, leading to a server<br>
        crash. (Bug#39022: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=39022)<br>
<br>
      * When building MySQL when using a different target directory<br>
        (for example using the VPATH environment variable), the build<br>
        of the embedded readline component would fail.<br>
        (Bug#35250: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=35250)<br>
<br>
      * INSERT INTO ... VALUES(DEFAULT) failed to insert the correct<br>
        value for ENUM columns. For MyISAM tables, an empty value was<br>
        inserted. For CSV tables, the table became corrupt.<br>
        (Bug#33717: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=33717)<br>
