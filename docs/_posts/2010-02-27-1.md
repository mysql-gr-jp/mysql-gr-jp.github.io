以下チェンジログ(5.5.2-m2):<br>
<br>
<br>
■InnoDBプラグイン関係：<br>
  * This release includes InnoDB Plugin 1.0.6. This version is<br>
    considered of Release Candidate (RC) quality.<br>
<br>
<br>
■機能の追加と変更<br>
  * Replication: Introduced the<br>
    --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates server option. This<br>
    option causes updates using the statement-based logging format<br>
    to tables using non-transactional engines to be written<br>
    directly to the binary log, rather than to the transaction<br>
    cache.<br>
    Before using this option, be certain that you have no<br>
    dependencies between transactional and non-transactional<br>
    tables. A statement that both selects from an InnoDB table and<br>
    inserts into a MyISAM table is an example of such a<br>
    dependency. For more information, see Section 16.1.3.4,<br>
    "Binary Log Options and Variables."<br>
    (Bug#46364: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=46364)<br>
    See also Bug#28976: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=28976,<br>
    Bug#40116: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=40116.<br>
<br>
<br>
■バグ修正<br>
  * Performance: The method for comparing INFORMATION_SCHEMA names<br>
    and database names was nonoptimal and an improvement was made:<br>
    When the database name length is already known, a length check<br>
    is made first and content comparison skipped if the lengths<br>
    are unequal.<br>
    (Bug#49501: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49501)<br>
<br>
  * Performance: The MD5() and SHA1() functions had excessive<br>
    overhead for short strings.<br>
    (Bug#49491: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49491)<br>
<br>
  * Security Fix: For servers built with yaSSL, a preauthorization<br>
    buffer overflow could cause memory corruption or a server<br>
    crash. We thank Evgeny Legerov from Intevydis for providing us<br>
    with a proof-of-concept script that allowed us to reproduce<br>
    this bug. (Bug#50227: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50227,<br>
    CVE-2009-4484<br>
    (http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-4484))<br>
<br>
  * Incompatible Change: In plugin.h, the MYSQL_REPLICATION_PLUGIN<br>
    symbol was out of synchrony with its value in MySQL 6.0<br>
    because the lower-valued MYSQL_AUDIT_PLUGIN was not present.<br>
    To correct this, MYSQL_AUDIT_PLUGIN has been added in MySQL<br>
    5.5, changing the value of MYSQL_REPLICATION_PLUGIN from 5 to<br>
<br>
    6. Attempts to load the audit plugin produce an error occurs<br>
    because only the MYSQL_AUDIT_PLUGIN symbol was added, not the<br>
    audit plugin itself. This error will go away when the audit<br>
    plugin is added to MySQL 5.5. Replication plugins from earlier<br>
    5.5.x releases must be recompiled against the current release<br>
    before they will work with the current release.<br>
    (Bug#49894: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49894)<br>
<br>
  * Important Change: Replication: The RAND() function is now<br>
    marked as unsafe for statement-based replication. Using this<br>
    function now generates a warning when binlog_format=STATEMENT<br>
    and causes the the format to switch to row-based logging when<br>
    binlog_format=MIXED.<br>
    This change is being introduced because, when RAND() was<br>
    logged in statement mode, the seed was also written to the<br>
    binary log, so the replication slave generated the same<br>
    sequence of random numbers as was generated on the master.<br>
    While this could make replication work in some cases, the<br>
    order of affected rows was still not guaranteed when this<br>
    function was used in statements that could update multiple<br>
    rows, such as UPDATE or INSERT ... SELECT; if the master and<br>
    the slave retrieved rows in different order, they began to<br>
    diverge. (Bug#49222: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49222)<br>
<br>
  * Partitioning: When used on partitioned tables, the<br>
    records_in_range handler call checked all partitions, rather<br>
    than the unpruned partitions only.<br>
    (Bug#48846: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48846)<br>
    See also Bug#37252: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=37252,<br>
    Bug#47261: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47261.<br>
<br>
  * Partitioning: When an ALTER TABLE ... REORGANIZE PARTITION<br>
    statement on an InnoDB table failed due to<br>
    innodb_lock_wait_timeout expiring while waiting for a lock,<br>
    InnoDB did not clean up any temporary files or tables which it<br>
    had created. Attempting to reissue the ALTER TABLE statement<br>
    following the timeout could lead to storage engine errors, or<br>
    possibly a crash of the server.<br>
    (Bug#47343: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47343)<br>
<br>
  * Replication: FLUSH LOGS could in some circumstances crash the<br>
    server. This occurred because the I/O thread could<br>
    concurrently access the relay log I/O cache while another<br>
    thread was performing the FLUSH LOGS, which closes and reopens<br>
    the relay log and, while doing so, initializes (or<br>
    re-initializes) its I/O cache. This could cause problems if<br>
    some other thread (in this case, the I/O thread) is accessing<br>
    it at the same time.<br>
    Now the thread performing the FLUSH LOGS takes a lock on the<br>
    relay log before actually flushing it.<br>
    (Bug#50364: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50364)<br>
<br>
  * Replication: With semisynchronous replication, memory<br>
    allocated for handling transactions could be freed while still<br>
    in use, resulting in a server crash.<br>
    (Bug#50157: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50157)<br>
<br>
  * Replication: In some cases, inserting into a table with many<br>
    columns could cause the binary log to become corrupted.<br>
    (Bug#50018: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50018)<br>
    See also Bug#42749: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=42749.<br>
<br>
  * Replication: When using row-based replication, setting a BIT<br>
    or CHAR column of a MyISAM table to NULL, then trying to<br>
    delete from the table, caused the slave to fail with the error<br>
    Can't find record in table.<br>
    (Bug#49481: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49481,<br>
    Bug#49482: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49482)<br>
<br>
  * Replication: A LOAD DATA INFILE statement that loaded data<br>
    into a table having a column name that had to be escaped (such<br>
    as `key` INT) caused replication to fail when logging in mixed<br>
    or statement mode. In such cases, the master wrote the LOAD<br>
    DATA event into the binary log without escaping the column<br>
    names. (Bug#49479: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49479)<br>
    See also Bug#47927: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47927.<br>
<br>
  * Replication: When logging in row-based mode, DDL statements<br>
    are actually logged as statements; however, statements that<br>
    affected temporary tables and followed DDL statements failed<br>
    to reset the binary log format to ROW, with the result that<br>
    these statements were logged using the statement-based format.<br>
    Now the state of binlog_format is restored after a DDL<br>
    statement has been written to the binary log.<br>
    (Bug#49132: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49132)<br>
<br>
  * Replication: Spatial data types caused row-based replication<br>
    to crash. (Bug#48776: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48776)<br>
<br>
  * Replication: When using row-based logging, the statement<br>
    CREATE TABLE t IF NOT EXIST ... SELECT was logged as CREATE<br>
    TEMPORARY TABLE t IF NOT EXIST ... SELECT when t already<br>
    existed as a temporary table. This was caused by the fact that<br>
    the temporary table was opened and the results of the SELECT<br>
    were inserted into it when a temporary table existed and had<br>
    the same name.<br>
    Now, when this statement is executed, t is created as a base<br>
    table, the results of the SELECT are inserted into it --- even<br>
    if there already exists a temporary table having the same name<br>
    --- and the statement is logged correctly.<br>
    (Bug#47418: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47418)<br>
    See also Bug#47442: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47442.<br>
<br>
  * Replication: Due to a change in the size of event<br>
    representations in the binary log, when replicating from a<br>
    MySQL 4.1 master to a slave running MySQL 5.0.60 or later, the<br>
    START SLAVE UNTIL statement did not function correctly,<br>
    stopping at the wrong position in the log. Now the slave<br>
    detects that the master is using the older version of the<br>
    binary log format, and corrects for the difference in event<br>
    size, so that the slave stops in the correct position.<br>
    (Bug#47142: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47142)<br>
<br>
  * Replication: Manually removing entries from the binary log<br>
    index file on a replication master could cause the server to<br>
    repeatedly send the same binary log file to slaves.<br>
    (Bug#28421: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=28421)<br>
<br>
  * The SSL certificates in the test suite were about to expire.<br>
    They have been updated with expiration dates in the year 2015.<br>
    (Bug#50642: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50642)<br>
<br>
  * SPATIAL indexes were allowed on columns with non-spatial data<br>
    types, resulting in a server crash for subsequent table<br>
    inserts. (Bug#50574: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50574)<br>
<br>
  * Index prefixes could be specified with a length greater than<br>
    the associated column, resulting in a server crash for<br>
    subsequent table inserts.<br>
    (Bug#50542: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50542)<br>
<br>
  * Use of loose index scan optimization for an aggregate function<br>
    with DISTINCT (for example, COUNT(DISTINCT)) could produce<br>
    incorrect results.<br>
    (Bug#50539: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50539)<br>
<br>
  * The printstack function does not exist on Solaris 8 or<br>
    earlier, which would lead to a compilation failure.<br>
    (Bug#50409: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50409)<br>
<br>
  * A user could see tables in INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES without<br>
    appropriate privileges for them.<br>
    (Bug#50276: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50276)<br>
<br>
  * Debug output for join structures was garbled.<br>
    (Bug#50271: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50271)<br>
<br>
  * Within a stored routine, selecting the result of CONCAT_WS()<br>
    with a routine parameter argument into a user variable could<br>
    return incorrect results.<br>
    (Bug#50096: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50096)<br>
<br>
  * The filesort sorting method applied to a CHAR(0) column could<br>
    lead to a server crash.<br>
    (Bug#49897: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49897)<br>
<br>
  * EXPLAIN EXTENDED UNION ... ORDER BY caused a crash when the<br>
    ORDER BY referred to a nonconstant or full-text function or a<br>
    subquery. (Bug#49734: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49734)<br>
<br>
  * Some prepared statements could raise an assertion when<br>
    re-executed.<br>
    (Bug#49570: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49570)<br>
<br>
  * sql_buffer_result had an effect on non-SELECT statements,<br>
    contrary to the documentation.<br>
    (Bug#49552: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49552)<br>
<br>
  * In some cases a subquery need not be evaluated because it<br>
    returns only aggregate values that can be calculated from<br>
    table metadata. This sometimes was not handled by the<br>
    enclosing subquery, resulting in a server crash.<br>
    (Bug#49512: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49512)<br>
<br>
  * Mixing full-text searches and row expressions caused a crash.<br>
    (Bug#49445: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49445)<br>
<br>
  * Creating or dropping a table with 1023 transactions active<br>
    caused an assertion failure.<br>
    (Bug#49238: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49238)<br>
<br>
  * mysql-test-run.pl now recognizes the MTR_TESTCASE_TIMEOUT,<br>
    MTR_SUITE_TIMEOUT, MTR_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT, and MTR_START_TIMEOUT<br>
    environment variables. If they are set, their values are used<br>
    to set the --testcase-timeout, --suite-timeout,<br>
    --shutdown-timeout, and --start-timeout options, respectively.<br>
    (Bug#49210: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49210)<br>
<br>
  * Several strmake() calls had an incorrect length argument (too<br>
    large by one).<br>
    (Bug#48983: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48983)<br>
<br>
  * On Fedora 12, strmov() did not guarantee correct operation for<br>
    overlapping source and destination buffer. Calls were fixed to<br>
    use an overlap-safe version instead.<br>
    (Bug#48866: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48866)<br>
<br>
  * With one thread waiting for a lock on a table, if another<br>
    thread dropped the table and created a new table with the same<br>
    name and structure, the first thread would not notice that the<br>
    table had been re-created and would try to used cached<br>
    metadata that belonged to the old table but had been freed.<br>
    (Bug#48157: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48157)<br>
<br>
  * If an invocation of a stored procedure failed in the<br>
    table-open stage, subsequent invocations that did not fail in<br>
    that stage could cause a crash.<br>
    (Bug#47649: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47649)<br>
<br>
  * A crash occurred when a user variable that was assigned to a<br>
    subquery result was used as a result field in a SELECT<br>
    statement with aggregate functions.<br>
    (Bug#47371: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47371)<br>
<br>
  * When the mysql client was invoked with the --vertical option,<br>
    it ignored the --skip-column-names option.<br>
    (Bug#47147: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47147)<br>
<br>
  * If EXPLAIN encountered an error in the query, a memory leak<br>
    occurred. (Bug#45989: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=45989)<br>
<br>
  * A race condition on the privilege hash tables allowed one<br>
    thread to try to delete elements that had already been deleted<br>
    by another thread. A consequence was that SET PASSWORD or<br>
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES could cause a crash.<br>
    (Bug#35589: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=35589,<br>
    Bug#35591: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=35591)<br>
<br>
  * 1) In rare cases, if a thread was interrupted during a FLUSH<br>
    PRIVILEGES operation, a debug assertion occurred later due to<br>
    improper diagnostic area setup. 2) A KILL operation could<br>
    cause a console error message referring to a diagnostic area<br>
    state without first ensuring that the state existed.<br>
    (Bug#33982: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=33982)<br>
<br>
  * ALTER TABLE with both DROP COLUMN and ADD COLUMN clauses could<br>
    crash or lock up the server.<br>
    (Bug#31145: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=31145)<br>
<br>
  * The Table_locks_waited waited variable was not incremented in<br>
    the cases that a lock had to be waited for but the waiting<br>
    thread was killed or the request was aborted.<br>
    (Bug#30331: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=30331)<br>
