MySQL　5.0.77 がリリースされました。<br>
<br>
前回の MySQL 5.0 シリーズのリリースは昨年末にソースコードのみの 5.0.75 だったので、久々のバイナリリリースになります。<br>
以下のURLからダウンロードできます。<br>
<br>
http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html<br>
<br>
<br>
------------------<br>
以下チェンジログ：<br>
■機能の追加と変更(5.0.77)：<br>
<br>
- Security Enhancement: To enable stricter control over the<br>
  location from which user-defined functions can be loaded,<br>
  the plugin_dir system variable has been backported from<br>
  MySQL 5.1. If the value is non-empty, user-defined<br>
  function object files can be loaded only from the<br>
  directory named by this variable. If the value is empty,<br>
  the behavior that is used prior to the inclusion of<br>
  plugin_dir applies: The UDF object files must be located<br>
  in a directory that is searched by your system's dynamic<br>
  linker. (Bug#37428: http://bugs.mysql.com/37428)<br>
<br>
- A new status variable, Queries, indicates the number of<br>
  statements executed by the server. This includes<br>
  statements executed within stored programs, unlike the<br>
  Questions variable which includes only statements sent to<br>
  the server by clients.<br>
  (Bug#41131: http://bugs.mysql.com/41131)<br>
<br>
- Previously, index hints did not work for FULLTEXT<br>
  searches. Now they work as follows:<br>
  For natural language mode searches, index hints are<br>
  silently ignored. For example, IGNORE INDEX(i) is ignored<br>
  with no warning and the index is still used.<br>
  For boolean mode searches, index hints are honored.<br>
  (Bug#38842: http://bugs.mysql.com/38842)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
■バグ修正(5.0.77):<br>
<br>
- Important Change: Security Fix: Additional corrections<br>
  were made for the symlink-related privilege problem<br>
  originally addressed in MySQL 5.0.60. The original fix<br>
  did not correctly handle the data directory path name if<br>
  it contained symlinked directories in its path, and the<br>
  check was made only at table-creation time, not at<br>
  table-opening time later.<br>
  (Bug#32167: http://bugs.mysql.com/32167, CVE-2008-2079<br>
  (http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2<br>
  079))<br>
  See also Bug#39277: http://bugs.mysql.com/39277.<br>
<br>
- Security Enhancement: The server consumed excess memory<br>
  while parsing statements with hundreds or thousands of<br>
  nested boolean conditions (such as OR (OR ... (OR ...<br>
  ))). This could lead to a server crash or incorrect<br>
  statement execution, or cause other client statements to<br>
  fail due to lack of memory. The latter result constitutes<br>
  a denial of service.<br>
  (Bug#38296: http://bugs.mysql.com/38296)<br>
<br>
- Incompatible Change: There were some problems using<br>
  DllMain() hook functions on Windows that automatically do<br>
  global and per-thread initialization for libmysqld.dll:<br>
<br>
     + Per-thread initialization: MySQL internally counts<br>
       the number of active threads, which causes a delay<br>
       in my_end() if not all threads have exited. But<br>
       there are threads that can be started either by<br>
       Windows internally (often in TCP/IP scenarios) or by<br>
       users. Those threads do not necessarily use<br>
       libmysql.dll functionality but still contribute to<br>
       the open-thread count. (One symptom is a five-second<br>
       delay in times for PHP scripts to finish.)<br>
<br>
     + Process-initialization: my_init() calls WSAStartup<br>
       that itself loads DLLs and can lead to a deadlock in<br>
       the Windows loader.<br>
<br>
  To correct these problems, DLL initialization code now is<br>
  not invoked from libmysql.dll by default. To obtain the<br>
  previous behavior (DLL initialization code will be<br>
  called), set the LIBMYSQL_DLLINIT environment variable to<br>
  any value. This variable exists only to prevent breakage<br>
  of existing Windows-only applications that do not call<br>
  mysql_thread_init() and work okay today. Use of<br>
  LIBMYSQL_DLLINIT is discouraged and is removed in MySQL<br>
  6.0. (Bug#37226: http://bugs.mysql.com/37226,<br>
  Bug#33031: http://bugs.mysql.com/33031)<br>
<br>
- Incompatible Change: SHOW STATUS took a lot of CPU time<br>
  for calculating the value of the<br>
  Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_latched status variable. Now<br>
  this variable is calculated and included in the output of<br>
  SHOW STATUS only if the UNIV_DEBUG symbol is defined at<br>
  MySQL build time.<br>
  (Bug#36600: http://bugs.mysql.com/36600)<br>
<br>
- Incompatible Change: In connection with view creation,<br>
  the server created arc directories inside database<br>
  directories and maintained useless copies of .frm files<br>
  there. Creation and renaming procedures of those copies<br>
  as well as creation of arc directories has been<br>
  discontinued.<br>
  This change does cause a problem when downgrading to<br>
  older server versions which manifests itself under these<br>
  circumstances:<br>
<br>
    1. Create a view v_orig in MySQL 5.0.72 or higher.<br>
<br>
    2. Rename the view to v_new and then back to v_orig.<br>
<br>
    3. Downgrade to an older 5.0.x server and run<br>
       mysql_upgrade.<br>
<br>
    4. Try to rename v_orig to v_new again. This operation<br>
       fails.<br>
<br>
  As a workaround to avoid this problem, use either of<br>
  these approaches:<br>
<br>
     + Dump your data using mysqldump before downgrading<br>
       and reload the dump file after downgrading.<br>
<br>
     + Instead of renaming a view after the downgrade, drop<br>
       it and recreate it.<br>
<br>
  The downgrade problem introduced by the fix for this bug<br>
  has been addressed as<br>
  Bug#40021: http://bugs.mysql.com/40021.<br>
  (Bug#17823: http://bugs.mysql.com/17823)<br>
<br>
- Replication: When rotating relay log files, the slave<br>
  deletes relay log files and then edits the relay log<br>
  index file. Formerly, if the slave shut down unexpectedly<br>
  between these two events, the relay log index file could<br>
  then reference relay logs that no longer existed.<br>
  Depending on the circumstances, this could when<br>
  restarting the slave cause either a race condition or the<br>
  failure of replication.<br>
  (Bug#38826: http://bugs.mysql.com/38826,<br>
  Bug#39325: http://bugs.mysql.com/39325)<br>
<br>
- In example option files provided in MySQL distributions,<br>
  the thread_stack value was increased from 64K to 128K.<br>
  (Bug#41577: http://bugs.mysql.com/41577)<br>
<br>
- SET PASSWORD caused a server crash if the account name<br>
  was given as CURRENT_USER().<br>
  (Bug#41456: http://bugs.mysql.com/41456)<br>
<br>
- The INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMA_PRIVILEGES table was<br>
  limited to 7680 rows.<br>
  (Bug#41079: http://bugs.mysql.com/41079)<br>
<br>
- In debug builds, obsolete debug code could be used to<br>
  crash the server.<br>
  (Bug#41041: http://bugs.mysql.com/41041)<br>
<br>
- CHECK TABLE ... FOR UPGRADE did not check for<br>
  incompatible collation changes made in MySQL 5.0.48<br>
  (Bug#27562: http://bugs.mysql.com/27562,<br>
  Bug#29461: http://bugs.mysql.com/29461,<br>
  Bug#29499: http://bugs.mysql.com/29499). This also<br>
  affects mysqlcheck and mysql_upgrade, which cause that<br>
  statement to be executed. See Section 2.18.3, "Checking<br>
  Whether Table Indexes Must Be Rebuilt."<br>
  (Bug#40984: http://bugs.mysql.com/40984)<br>
  See also Bug#39585: http://bugs.mysql.com/39585.<br>
<br>
- Some queries that used a "range checked for each record"<br>
  scan could return incorrect results.<br>
  (Bug#40974: http://bugs.mysql.com/40974)<br>
<br>
- Certain SELECT queries could fail with a Duplicate entry<br>
  error. (Bug#40953: http://bugs.mysql.com/40953)<br>
<br>
- The FEDERATED handler had a memory leak.<br>
  (Bug#40875: http://bugs.mysql.com/40875)<br>
<br>
- IF(..., CAST(longtext_val AS UNSIGNED), signed_val) as an<br>
  argument to an aggregate function could cause an<br>
  assertion failure.<br>
  (Bug#40761: http://bugs.mysql.com/40761)<br>
<br>
- Prepared statements allowed invalid dates to be inserted<br>
  when the ALLOW_INVALID_DATES SQL mode was not enabled.<br>
  (Bug#40365: http://bugs.mysql.com/40365)<br>
<br>
- mc.exe is no longer needed to compile MySQL on Windows.<br>
  This makes it possible to build MySQL from source using<br>
  Visual Studio Express 2008.<br>
  (Bug#40280: http://bugs.mysql.com/40280)<br>
<br>
- Support for the revision field in .frm files has been<br>
  removed. This addresses the downgrading problem<br>
  introduced by the fix for<br>
  Bug#17823: http://bugs.mysql.com/17823.<br>
  (Bug#40021: http://bugs.mysql.com/40021)<br>
<br>
- If the operating system is configured to return leap<br>
  seconds from OS time calls or if the MySQL server uses a<br>
  time zone definition that has leap seconds, functions<br>
  such as NOW() could return a value having a time part<br>
  that ends with :59:60 or :59:61. If such values are<br>
  inserted into a table, they would be dumped as is by<br>
  mysqldump but considered invalid when reloaded, leading<br>
  to backup/restore problems.<br>
  Now leap second values are returned with a time part that<br>
  ends with :59:59. This means that a function such as<br>
  NOW() can return the same value for two or three<br>
  consecutive seconds during the leap second. It remains<br>
  true that literal temporal values having a time part that<br>
  ends with :59:60 or :59:61 are considered invalid.<br>
  For additional details about leap-second handling, see<br>
  Section 9.7.2, "Time Zone Leap Second Support."<br>
  (Bug#39920: http://bugs.mysql.com/39920)<br>
<br>
- The server could crash during a sort-order optimization<br>
  of a dependent subquery.<br>
  (Bug#39844: http://bugs.mysql.com/39844)<br>
<br>
- With the ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY SQL mode enabled, the check<br>
  for non-aggregated columns in queries with aggregate<br>
  functions, but without a GROUP BY clause was treating all<br>
  the parts of the query as if they were in the select<br>
  list. This is fixed by ignoring the non-aggregated<br>
  columns in the WHERE clause.<br>
  (Bug#39656: http://bugs.mysql.com/39656)<br>
<br>
- The server crashed if an integer field in a CSV file did<br>
  not have delimiting quotes.<br>
  (Bug#39616: http://bugs.mysql.com/39616)<br>
<br>
- CHECK TABLE failed for MyISAM INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables.<br>
  (Bug#39541: http://bugs.mysql.com/39541)<br>
<br>
- For a TIMESTAMP column in an InnoDB table, testing the<br>
  column with multiple conditions in the WHERE clause<br>
  caused a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#39353: http://bugs.mysql.com/39353)<br>
<br>
- The server returned a column type of VARBINARY rather<br>
  than DATE as the result from the COALESCE(), IFNULL(),<br>
  IF(), GREATEST(), or LEAST() functions or CASE expression<br>
  if the result was obtained using filesort in an anonymous<br>
  temporary table during the query execution.<br>
  (Bug#39283: http://bugs.mysql.com/39283)<br>
<br>
- References to local variables in stored procedures are<br>
  replaced with NAME_CONST(name, value) when written to the<br>
  binary log. However, an "illegal mix of collation" error<br>
  might occur when executing the log contents if the<br>
  value's collation differed from that of the variable. Now<br>
  information about the variable collation is written as<br>
  well. (Bug#39182: http://bugs.mysql.com/39182)<br>
<br>
- Some recent releases for Solaris 10 were built on Solaris<br>
  10 U5, which included a new version of libnsl.so that<br>
  does not work on U4 or earlier. To correct this, Solaris<br>
  10 builds now are created on machines that do not have<br>
  that upgraded libnsl.so, so that they will work on<br>
  Solaris 10 installations both with and without the<br>
  upgraded libnsl.so.<br>
  (Bug#39074: http://bugs.mysql.com/39074)<br>
<br>
- With binary logging enabled CREATE VIEW was subject to<br>
  possible buffer overwrite and a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#39040: http://bugs.mysql.com/39040)<br>
<br>
- Queries of the form SELECT ... REGEXP BINARY NULL could<br>
  lead to a hung or crashed server.<br>
  (Bug#39021: http://bugs.mysql.com/39021)<br>
<br>
- Statements of the form INSERT ... SELECT .. ON DUPLICATE<br>
  KEY UPDATE col_name = DEFAULT could result in a server<br>
  crash. (Bug#39002: http://bugs.mysql.com/39002)<br>
<br>
- Column names constructed due to wild-card expansion done<br>
  inside a stored procedure could point to freed memory if<br>
  the expansion was performed after the first call to the<br>
  stored procedure.<br>
  (Bug#38823: http://bugs.mysql.com/38823)<br>
<br>
- Repeated CREATE TABLE ... SELECT statements, where the<br>
  created table contained an AUTO_INCREMENT column, could<br>
  lead to an assertion failure.<br>
  (Bug#38821: http://bugs.mysql.com/38821)<br>
<br>
- If delayed insert failed to upgrade the lock, it did not<br>
  free the temporary memory storage used to keep newly<br>
  constructed BLOB values in memory, resulting in a memory<br>
  leak. (Bug#38693: http://bugs.mysql.com/38693)<br>
<br>
- A server crash resulted from concurrent execution of a<br>
  multiple-table UPDATE that used a NATURAL or USING join<br>
  together with FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK or ALTER TABLE<br>
  for the table being updated.<br>
  (Bug#38691: http://bugs.mysql.com/38691)<br>
<br>
- On ActiveState Perl, mysql-test-run.pl --start-and-exit<br>
  started but did not exit.<br>
  (Bug#38629: http://bugs.mysql.com/38629)<br>
<br>
- Server-side cursors were not initialized properly, which<br>
  could cause a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#38486: http://bugs.mysql.com/38486)<br>
<br>
- Stored procedures involving substrings could crash the<br>
  server on certain platforms due to invalid memory reads.<br>
  (Bug#38469: http://bugs.mysql.com/38469)<br>
<br>
- A server crash or Valgrind warnings could result when a<br>
  stored procedure selected from a view that referenced a<br>
  function. (Bug#38291: http://bugs.mysql.com/38291)<br>
<br>
- Incorrect handling of aggregate functions when loose<br>
  index scan was used caused a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#38195: http://bugs.mysql.com/38195)<br>
<br>
- Queries containing a subquery with DISTINCT and ORDER BY<br>
  could cause a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#38191: http://bugs.mysql.com/38191)<br>
<br>
- Queries with a HAVING clause could return a spurious row.<br>
  (Bug#38072: http://bugs.mysql.com/38072)<br>
<br>
- Use of spatial data types in prepared statements could<br>
  cause memory leaks or server crashes.<br>
  (Bug#37956: http://bugs.mysql.com/37956,<br>
  Bug#37671: http://bugs.mysql.com/37671)<br>
<br>
- The server crashed if an argument to a stored procedure<br>
  was a subquery that returned more than one row.<br>
  (Bug#37949: http://bugs.mysql.com/37949)<br>
<br>
- When analyzing the possible index use cases, the server<br>
  was incorrectly reusing an internal structure, leading to<br>
  a server crash. (Bug#37943: http://bugs.mysql.com/37943)<br>
<br>
- A SELECT with a NULL NOT IN condition containing a<br>
  complex subquery from the same table as in the outer<br>
  select caused an assertion failure.<br>
  (Bug#37894: http://bugs.mysql.com/37894)<br>
<br>
- For InnoDB tables, ORDER BY ... DESC sometimes returned<br>
  results in ascending order.<br>
  (Bug#37830: http://bugs.mysql.com/37830)<br>
<br>
- If a table has a BIT NOT NULL column c1 with a length<br>
  shorter than 8 bits and some additional NOT NULL columns<br>
  c2, ..., and a SELECT query has a WHERE clause of the<br>
  form (c1 = constant) AND c2 ..., the query could return<br>
  an unexpected result set.<br>
  (Bug#37799: http://bugs.mysql.com/37799)<br>
<br>
- Nesting of IF() inside of SUM() could cause an extreme<br>
  server slowdown. (Bug#37662: http://bugs.mysql.com/37662)<br>
<br>
- The MONTHNAME() and DAYNAME() functions returned a binary<br>
  string, so that using LOWER() or UPPER() had no effect.<br>
  Now MONTHNAME() and DAYNAME() return a value in<br>
  character_set_connection character set.<br>
  (Bug#37575: http://bugs.mysql.com/37575)<br>
<br>
- TIMEDIFF() was erroneously treated as always returning a<br>
  positive result. Also, CAST() of TIME values to DECIMAL<br>
  dropped the sign of negative values.<br>
  (Bug#37553: http://bugs.mysql.com/37553)<br>
<br>
- mysqlcheck used SHOW FULL TABLES to get the list of<br>
  tables in a database. For some problems, such as an empty<br>
  .frm file for a table, this would fail and mysqlcheck<br>
  then would neglect to check other tables in the database.<br>
  (Bug#37527: http://bugs.mysql.com/37527)<br>
<br>
- The <=> operator could return incorrect results when<br>
  comparing NULL to DATE, TIME, or DATETIME values.<br>
  (Bug#37526: http://bugs.mysql.com/37526)<br>
<br>
- Updating a view with a subquery in the CHECK option could<br>
  cause an assertion failure.<br>
  (Bug#37460: http://bugs.mysql.com/37460)<br>
<br>
- Statements that displayed the value of system variables<br>
  (for example, SHOW VARIABLES) expect variable values to<br>
  be encoded in character_set_system. However, variables<br>
  set from the command line such as basedir or datadir were<br>
  encoded using character_set_filesystem and not converted<br>
  correctly. (Bug#37339: http://bugs.mysql.com/37339)<br>
<br>
- For a MyISAM table with CHECKSUM = 1 and ROW_FORMAT =<br>
  DYNAMIC table options, a data consistency check (maximum<br>
  record length) could fail and cause the table to be<br>
  marked as corrupted.<br>
  (Bug#37310: http://bugs.mysql.com/37310)<br>
<br>
- The max_length result set metadata value was calculated<br>
  incorrectly under some circumstances.<br>
  (Bug#37301: http://bugs.mysql.com/37301)<br>
<br>
- CREATE INDEX could crash with InnoDB plugin 1.0.1.<br>
  (Bug#37284: http://bugs.mysql.com/37284)<br>
<br>
- Certain boolean-mode FULLTEXT searches that used the<br>
  truncation operator did not return matching records and<br>
  calculated relevance incorrectly.<br>
  (Bug#37245: http://bugs.mysql.com/37245)<br>
<br>
- The NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES SQL mode was ignored for LOAD<br>
  DATA INFILE and SELECT INTO ... OUTFILE. The setting is<br>
  taken into account now.<br>
  (Bug#37114: http://bugs.mysql.com/37114)<br>
<br>
- On a 32-bit server built without big tables support, the<br>
  offset argument in a LIMIT clause might be truncated due<br>
  to a 64-bit to 32-bit cast.<br>
  (Bug#37075: http://bugs.mysql.com/37075)<br>
<br>
- If the server failed to expire binary log files at<br>
  startup, it could crash.<br>
  (Bug#37027: http://bugs.mysql.com/37027)<br>
<br>
- The code for the ut_usectime() function in InnoDB did not<br>
  handle errors from the gettimeofday() system call. Now it<br>
  retries gettimeofday() several times and updates the<br>
  value of the Innodb_row_lock_time_max status variable<br>
  only if ut_usectime() was successful.<br>
  (Bug#36819: http://bugs.mysql.com/36819)<br>
<br>
- Use of CONVERT() with GROUP BY to convert numeric values<br>
  to CHAR could return truncated results.<br>
  (Bug#36772: http://bugs.mysql.com/36772)<br>
<br>
- A query which had an ORDER BY DESC clause that is<br>
  satisfied with a reverse range scan could cause a server<br>
  crash for some specific CPU/compiler combinations.<br>
  (Bug#36639: http://bugs.mysql.com/36639)<br>
<br>
- Dumping information about locks in use by sending a<br>
  SIGHUP signal to the server or by invoking the mysqladmin<br>
  debug command could lead to a server crash in debug<br>
  builds or to undefined behavior in production builds.<br>
  (Bug#36579: http://bugs.mysql.com/36579)<br>
<br>
- The mysql client, when built with Visual Studio 2005, did<br>
  not display Japanese characters.<br>
  (Bug#36279: http://bugs.mysql.com/36279)<br>
<br>
- When the fractional part in a multiplication of DECIMAL<br>
  values overflowed, the server truncated the first operand<br>
  rather than the longest. Now the server truncates so as<br>
  to produce more precise multiplications.<br>
  (Bug#36270: http://bugs.mysql.com/36270)<br>
<br>
- A read past the end of the string could occur while<br>
  parsing the value of the --innodb-data-file-path option.<br>
  (Bug#36149: http://bugs.mysql.com/36149)<br>
<br>
- Host name values in SQL statements were not being checked<br>
  for '@', which is illegal according to RFC952.<br>
  (Bug#35924: http://bugs.mysql.com/35924)<br>
<br>
- The UUID() function returned UUIDs with the wrong time;<br>
  this was because the offset for the time part in UUIDs<br>
  was miscalculated.<br>
  (Bug#35848: http://bugs.mysql.com/35848)<br>
<br>
- SHOW CREATE TABLE did not display a printable value for<br>
  the default value of BIT columns.<br>
  (Bug#35796: http://bugs.mysql.com/35796)<br>
<br>
- mysql_install_db failed on machines that had the host<br>
  name set to localhost.<br>

<br>
- Dynamic plugins failed to load on i5/OS.<br>
  (Bug#35743: http://bugs.mysql.com/35743)<br>
<br>
- Freeing of an internal parser stack during parsing of<br>
  complex stored programs caused a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#35577: http://bugs.mysql.com/35577,<br>
  Bug#37269: http://bugs.mysql.com/37269,<br>
  Bug#37228: http://bugs.mysql.com/37228)<br>
<br>
- The max_length metadata value was calculated incorrectly<br>
  for the FORMAT() function, which could cause incorrect<br>
  result set metadata to be sent to clients.<br>
  (Bug#35558: http://bugs.mysql.com/35558)<br>
<br>
- Index scans performed with the sort_union() access method<br>
  returned wrong results, caused memory to be leaked, and<br>
  caused temporary files to be deleted when the limit set<br>

- If the server crashed with an InnoDB error due to<br>
  unavailability of undo slots, errors could persist during<br>
  rollback when the server was restarted: There are two<br>
  UNDO slot caches (for INSERT and UPDATE). If all slots<br>
  end up in one of the slot caches, a request for a slot<br>
  from the other slot cache would fail. This can happen if<br>
  the request is for an UPDATE slot and all slots are in<br>
  the INSERT slot cache, or vice versa.<br>

  table '...', the same error as for base tables without an<br>
  appropriate index.<br>
