MySQL 4.1.14 がリリースされました。<br>
<br>
以下、チェンジログ<br>
----<br>
■機能の追加と変更：<br>
<br>
-SHOW CHARACTER SET and INFORMATION_SCHEMA now properly report the Latin1 character set as cp1252. (Bug #11216 (http://bugs.mysql.com/11216))<br>
<br>
-MySQL Cluster: A new -p option is available for use with the ndb_mgmd client. When called with this option, ndb_mgmd prints all configuration data to stdout, then exits.<br>
<br>
-The output of perror --help now displays the --ndb option. (Bug #11999 (http://bugs.mysql.com/11999))<br>
<br>
-NDB: Improved handling of the configuration variables NoOfPagesToDiskDuringRestartACC, NoOfPagesToDiskAfterRestartACC, NoOfPagesToDiskDuringRestartTUP, and NoOfPagesToDiskAfterRestartTUP should result in noticeably faster startup times for MySQL Cluster. (Bug #12149 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12149))<br>
<br>
-Added support of where clause for queries with FROM DUAL. (Bug #11745 (http://bugs.mysql.com/11745))<br>
<br>
-Added an optimization that avoids key access with NULL keys for the ref method when used in outer joins. (Bug #12144 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12144))<br>
<br>
-Added new query cache test for the embedded server to the test suite, there are now specific tests for the embedded and non-embedded servers. (Bug #9508 (http://bugs.mysql.com/9508))<br>
<br>
-Query cache is switched off if a thread (connection) has tables locked. This prevents invalid results where the locking thread inserts values between a second thread connecting and selecting from the table. (Bug #12385 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12385))<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
■バグ修正：<br>
<br>
-Slave I/O threads were considered to be in the running state when launched (rather than after successfully connecting to the master server), resulting in incorrect SHOW SLAVE STATUS output. (Bug #10780 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10780))<br>
<br>
-On Windows, the server could crash during shutdown if both replication threads and normal client connection threads were active. (Bug #11796 (http://bugs.mysql.com/11796))<br>
<br>
-Some subqueries of the form SELECT ... WHERE ROW(...) IN (subquery) were being handled incorrectly. (Bug #11867 (http://bugs.mysql.com/11867))<br>
<br>

<br>
-Renamed the rest() macro in my_list.h to list_rest() to avoid name clashes with user code. (Bug #12327 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12327))<br>
<br>
-myisampack failed to delete .TMD temporary files when run with -T option. (Bug #12235 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12235))<br>

<br>
-For PKG installs on Mac OS X, the preinstallation and postinstallation scripts were being run only for new installations and not for upgrade installations, resulting in an incomplete installation process. (Bug #11380 (http://bugs.mysql.com/11380))<br>
<br>
-User variables were not automatically cast for comparisons, causing queries to fail if the column and connection character sets differed. Now when mixing strings with different character sets but the same coercibility, allow conversion if one character set is a superset of the other. (Bug #10892 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10892))<br>
<br>
-Pathame values for options such as ---basedir or --datadir didn't work on Japanese Windows machines for directory names containing multibyte characters having a second byte of 0x5C ('\'). (Bug #5439 (http://bugs.mysql.com/5439))<br>
<br>
-Mishanding of comparison for rows containg NULL values against rows produced by an IN subquery could cause a server crash. (Bug #12392 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12392))<br>

<br>
-Creation of the mysql group account failed during the RPM installation. (Bug #12348 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12348))<br>
<br>
-FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK combined with LOCK TABLE .. WRITE caused deadlock. (Bug #9459 (http://bugs.mysql.com/9459))<br>

<br>

<br>
-For prepared statements, the SQL parser did not disallow '?' parameter markers immediately adjacent to other tokens, which could result in malformed statements in the binary log.

<br>
-GROUP_CONCAT() sometimes returned a result with a different collation that that of its arguments. (Bug #10201 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10201))<br>
<br>
-When two threads compete for the same table, a deadlock could occur if one thread has also a lock on another table through LOCK TABLES and the thread is attempting to remove the table in some manner and the other thread want locks on both tables. (Bug #10600 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10600))<br>
<br>

<br>
-References to system variables in an SQL statement prepared with PREPARE were evaluated during EXECUTE to their values at prepare time, not to their values at execution time. (Bug #9359 (http://bugs.mysql.com/9359))<br>
