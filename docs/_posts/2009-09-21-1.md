■バグ修正：<br>
* Partitioning: An INSERT ... SELECT statement on an empty<br>
  partition of a partitioned table failed with ERROR 1030<br>
  (HY000): Got error 124 from storage engine. This issue also<br>
  caused queries run against a partitioned table while a LOAD<br>
  DATA CONCURRENT INFILE statement was in progress to fail with<br>
  the same error. (Bug#46639: http://bugs.mysql.com/46639)<br>
  See also Bug#35845: http://bugs.mysql.com/35845,<br>
  Bug#44657: http://bugs.mysql.com/44657,<br>
  Bug#45840: http://bugs.mysql.com/45840.<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: A partitioned table having a TIMESTAMP column<br>
  with a default value of CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and this column was<br>
  not defined using an ON UPDATE option, an ALTER TABLE ...<br>
  REORGANIZE PARTITION statement on the table caused the<br>
  TIMESTAMP column value to be set to CURRENT_TIMESTAMP<br>
  regardless. (Bug#46478: http://bugs.mysql.com/46478)<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: Attempting to access a partitioned table when<br>
  partitioning support was disabled in a MySQL server binary<br>
  that had been compiled with partitioning support caused the<br>
  server to crash. (Bug#39893: http://bugs.mysql.com/39893)<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: The use of TO_DAYS() in the partitioning<br>
  expression led to selection failures when the column having<br>
  the date value contained invalid dates. This occurred because<br>
  the function returns NULL in such cases, and the partition<br>
  containing NULL values was pruned away. For example, this<br>
  problem occurred if '2001-02-00' was inserted into a DATE<br>
  column of such a table, and a subsequent query on this table<br>
  used WHERE date_col < '2001-02-00' --- while '2001-01-01' is<br>
  less than '2001-02-00', TO_DAYS('2001-02-00') evaluates as<br>
  NULL, and so the row containing '2001-01-01' was not returned.<br>
  Now, for tables using RANGE or LIST partitioning and having<br>
  TO_DAYS() in the partitioning expression, the NULL partition<br>
  is also scanned instead of being ignored.<br>
  The fix for this issue also corrects misbehavior such that a<br>
  query of the form SELECT * FROM table WHERE date_col <<br>
  date_val on a table partitioned by RANGE or LIST was handled<br>
  as though the server SQL mode included ALLOW_INVALID_DATES<br>
  even if this was not actually part of the server SQL mode at<br>
  the time the query was issued.<br>

<br>
* Replication: Performing a multi-row update of the<br>
  AUTO_INCREMENT column of a transactional table could result in<br>
  an inconsistency between master and slave when there was a<br>
  trigger on the transactional table that updated a<br>
  non-transactional table. When such an update failed on the<br>
  master, no rows were updated on the master, but some rows<br>
  could (erroneously) be updated on the slave.<br>
  (Bug#46864: http://bugs.mysql.com/46864)<br>
<br>
* Replication: When using the --replicate-rewrite-db option and<br>
  the database referenced by this option on the master was the<br>
  current database when the connection to the slave was closed,<br>
  any temporary tables existing in this database were not<br>
  properly dropped. (Bug#46861: http://bugs.mysql.com/46861)<br>
<br>
* Replication: When a statement that changed both transactional<br>
  and non-transactional tables failed, the transactional changes<br>
  were automatically rolled back on the master but the slave<br>
  ignored the error and did not roll them back, thus leading to<br>
  inconsistencies between master and slave.<br>
  This issue is fixed by automatically rolling back a statement<br>
  that fails on the slave; however, the transaction is not<br>
  rolled back unless a corresponding ROLLBACK statement is found<br>
  in the relay log file.<br>
  (Bug#46130: http://bugs.mysql.com/46130)<br>
  See also Bug#33864: http://bugs.mysql.com/33864.<br>
<br>
* Replication: When slave_transaction_retries is set, a<br>
  statement that replicates, but is then rolled back due to a<br>
  deadlock on the slave, should be retried. However, in certain<br>
  cases, replication was stopped with error 1213 (Deadlock found<br>
  when trying to get lock; try restarting transaction) instead,<br>
  even when this variable was set.<br>
  (Bug#45694: http://bugs.mysql.com/45694)<br>
<br>
* Replication: The binary logging behavior (and thus, the<br>
  replication behavior) of CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS, CREATE<br>
  TABLE IF NOT EXISTS, and CREATE EVENT IF NOT EXISTS was not<br>
  consistent among these statements, nor with that of DROP<br>
  DATABASE IF EXISTS, DROP TABLE IF EXISTS, and DROP EVENT IF<br>
  EXISTS: A DROP ... IF EXISTS statement is always logged even<br>
  if the database object named in the statement does not exist.<br>
  However, of the CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS statements, only the<br>
  CREATE EVENT IF NOT EXISTS statement was logged when the<br>
  database object named in the statement already existed.<br>
  Now, every CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS statement is written to<br>
  the binary log (and thus replicated), whether the database<br>
  object named in the statement exists or not. For more<br>
  information, see Section 16.3.1.3, "Replication of CREATE ...<br>
  IF NOT EXISTS Statements."<br>
  Exception.  Replication and logging of CREATE TABLE IF NOT<br>
  EXISTS ... SELECT continues to be handled according to<br>
  existing rules. See Section 16.3.1.4, "Replication of CREATE<br>
  TABLE ... SELECT Statements," for more information.<br>
  (Bug#45574: http://bugs.mysql.com/45574)<br>
<br>
* Replication: When using statement-based replication,<br>
  database-level character sets were not always honored by the<br>
  replication SQL thread. This could cause data inserted on the<br>
  master using LOAD DATA to be replicated using the wrong<br>
  character set.<br>
<br>
  Note<br>
  This was not an issue when using row-based replication.<br>
  (Bug#45516: http://bugs.mysql.com/45516)<br>
<br>
* Replication: In some cases, a STOP SLAVE statement could cause<br>
  the replication slave to crash. This issue was specific to<br>
  MySQL on Windows or Macintosh platforms.<br>
  (Bug#45238: http://bugs.mysql.com/45238,<br>

  Bug#46014: http://bugs.mysql.com/46014,<br>
  Bug#46030: http://bugs.mysql.com/46030)<br>
<br>
* Replication: Creating a scheduled event whose DEFINER clause<br>
  was either set to CURRENT_USER or not set explicitly caused<br>
  the master and the slave to become inconsistent. This issue<br>
  stems from the fact that, in both cases, the DEFINER is set to<br>
  the CURRENT_USER of the current thread. (On the master, the<br>
  CURRENT_USER is the mysqld user; on the slave, the<br>
  CURRENT_USER is empty.)<br>
  This behavior has been modified as follows:<br>
<br>
     + If CURRENT_USER is used as the DEFINER, it is replaced<br>
       with the value of CURRENT_USER before the CREATE EVENT<br>
       statement is written to the binary log.<br>
<br>
     + If the definer is not set explicitly, a DEFINER clause<br>
       using the value of CURRENT_USER is added to the CREATE<br>
       EVENT statement before it is written to the binary log.<br>
  (Bug#44331: http://bugs.mysql.com/44331)<br>
  See also Bug#42217: http://bugs.mysql.com/42217.<br>
<br>
* Replication: When using the statement-based logging format,<br>
  the only possible safe combination of transactional and<br>
  non-transactional statements within the same transaction is to<br>
  perform any updates on non-transactional tables (such as<br>
  MyISAM tables) first, before updating any transactional tables<br>
  (such as those using the InnoDB storage engine). This is due<br>
  to the fact that, although a modification made to a<br>
  non-transactional table is immediately visible to other<br>
  connections, the update is not immediately written to the<br>
  binary log, which can lead to inconsistencies between master<br>
  and slave. (Other combinations may hide a causal dependency,<br>
  thus making it impossible to write statements updating<br>
  non-transactional tables to the binary log in the correct<br>
  order.)<br>
  However, in some cases, this situation was not handled<br>
  properly, and the determination whether a given statement was<br>
  safe or not under these conditions was not always correct. In<br>
  particular, a multi-table update that affected both<br>
  transactional and non-transactional tables or a statement<br>
  modifying data in a non-transactional table having a trigger<br>
  that operated on a transactional table (or the reverse) was<br>
  not determined to be unsafe when it should have been.<br>
  With this fix, the following determinations regarding<br>
  replication safety are made when combining updates to<br>
  transactional and non-transactional tables within the same<br>
  transaction in statement-based logging mode:<br>
<br>
    1. Any statement modifying data in a non-transactional table<br>
       within a given transaction is considered safe if it is<br>
       issued prior to any data modification statement accessing<br>
       a transactional table within the same transaction.<br>
<br>
    2. A statement that updates transactional tables only is<br>
       always considered safe.<br>
<br>
    3. A statement affecting both transactional and<br>
       non-transactional tables within a transaction is always<br>
       considered unsafe. It is not necessary that both tables<br>
       be modified for this to be true; for example, a statement<br>
       such as INSERT INTO innodb_table SELECT * FROM<br>
       myisam_table is also considered unsafe.<br>
<br>
  Note<br>
  The current fix is valid only when using statement-based<br>
  logging mode; we plan to address similar issues occurring when<br>
  using the MIXED or ROW format in a future MySQL release.<br>
  (Bug#28976: http://bugs.mysql.com/28976)<br>
<br>
* Stack overflow checking did not account for the size of the<br>
  structure stored in the heap.<br>
  (Bug#46807: http://bugs.mysql.com/46807)<br>
<br>
* In queries for which the loose index scan access method was<br>
  chosen, using a condition of the form col_name rather than the<br>
  equivalent col_name <> 0 caused an assertion failure.<br>
  (Bug#46607: http://bugs.mysql.com/46607)<br>
<br>
* Killing a query that was performing a sort could result in a<br>
  memory leak. (Bug#45962: http://bugs.mysql.com/45962)<br>
<br>
* Truncation of DECIMAL values could lead to assertion failures;<br>
  for example, when deducing the type of a table column from a<br>
  literal DECIMAL value.<br>
  (Bug#45261: http://bugs.mysql.com/45261)<br>
<br>
* Bulk insert performance could suffer with large<br>
  read_buffer_size values.<br>
  (Bug#44723: http://bugs.mysql.com/44723)<br>
<br>
* A buffer overflow could occur during handling of IS NULL<br>
  ranges. (Bug#37044: http://bugs.mysql.com/37044)<br>
<br>
* mysqladmin --wait ping crashed on Windows systems.<br>
