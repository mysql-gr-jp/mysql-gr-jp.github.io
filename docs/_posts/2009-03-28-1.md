　MySQL 6.0.10-alpha がリリースされました。<br>
これは MySQL 6.0 シリーズの最新バージョンで、6.0シリーズは現在アルファー版です。　安定版がリリースされている最新版は、MySQL 5.1 シリーズです。<br>
<br>
　注意：　このバージョンに含まれる Falcon ストレージエンジンにはバグが含まれています。 このバージョン(MySQL 6.0.10)をビルドした後に発覚した問題があるようですので、Falcon を使用したい人は 6.0.9-alpha のままにするか、 6.0.11のリリースまで待つことが強く勧められています。<br>

以下、チェンジログ(6.0.10-alpha)<br>
■機能の追加と変更(6.0.10-alpha)：<br>
- Important Change: Replication: RESET MASTER and RESET SLAVE<br>
  now reset the values shown for Last_IO_Error, Last_IO_Errno,<br>
  Last_SQL_Error, and Last_SQL_Errno in the output of SHOW SLAVE<br>
  STATUS. (Bug#34654: http://bugs.mysql.com/34654)<br>
<br>
- Replication: A new global server variable sync_relay_log is<br>
  introduced for use on replication slaves. Setting this<br>
  variable to a nonzero integer value N causes the slave to<br>
  synchonize the relay log to disk after every N events. It is<br>
  analogous to how the sync_binlog variable works for binary<br>
  logs on a replication master.<br>
  This variable can also be set in my.cnf using the server<br>
  option --sync-relay-log.<br>
  For more information, see Section 16.1.3.3, "Replication Slave<br>
  Options and Variables."<br>
  (Bug#31665: http://bugs.mysql.com/31665,<br>
  Bug#35542: http://bugs.mysql.com/35542,<br>
  Bug#40337: http://bugs.mysql.com/40337)<br>
<br>
- Replication: In circular replication, it was sometimes<br>
  possible for an event to propagate such that it would be<br>
  reapplied on all servers. This could occur when the<br>
  originating server was removed from the replication circle and<br>
  so could no longer act as the terminator of its own events, as<br>
  normally happens in circular replication.<br>
  In order to prevent this from occurring, a new<br>
  IGNORE_SERVER_IDS option is introduced for the CHANGE MASTER<br>
  TO statement. This option takes a list of replication server<br>
  IDs; events having a server ID which appears in this list are<br>
  ignored and not applied. For more information, see Section<br>
  12.6.2.1, "CHANGE MASTER TO Syntax."<br>
  (Bug#25998: http://bugs.mysql.com/25998)<br>
  See also Bug#27808: http://bugs.mysql.com/27808.<br>
<br>
- The libedit library was upgraded to version 2.11.<br>
  (Bug#42433: http://bugs.mysql.com/42433)<br>
<br>
- A new status variable, Queries, indicates the number of<br>
  statements executed by the server. This includes statements<br>
  executed within stored programs, unlike the Questions variable<br>
  which includes only statements sent to the server by clients.<br>
  (Bug#41131: http://bugs.mysql.com/41131)<br>
<br>
- Columns that provide a catalog value in INFORMATION_SCHEMA<br>
  tables (for example, TABLES.TABLE_CATALOG) now have a value of<br>
  def rather than NULL. (Bug#35427: http://bugs.mysql.com/35427)<br>
<br>
- mysql-test-run.pl now supports --client-bindir and<br>
  --client-libdir options for specifying the directory where<br>
  client binaries and libraries are located.<br>
  (Bug#34995: http://bugs.mysql.com/34995)<br>
<br>
<br>
■バグ修正(6.0.10-alpha)：<br>
- Security Fix: Using an XPath expression employing a scalar<br>
  expression as a FilterExpr<br>
  (http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath#NT-FilterExpr) with ExtractValue()<br>
  or UpdateXML() caused the server to crash. Such expressions<br>
  now cause an error instead.<br>
  (Bug#42495: http://bugs.mysql.com/42495)<br>
<br>
- Incompatible Change: The fix for<br>
  Bug#33699: http://bugs.mysql.com/33699 introduced a change to<br>
  the UPDATE statement such that assigning NULL to a NOT NULL<br>
  column caused an error even when strict SQL mode was not<br>
  enabled. The original behavior before was that such<br>
  assignments caused an error only in strict SQL mode, and<br>
  otherwise set the column to the the implicit default value for<br>
  the column data type and generated a warning. (For information<br>
  about implicit default values, see Section 10.1.4, "Data Type<br>
  Default Values.")<br>
  The change caused compatibility problems for applications that<br>
  relied on the original behavior. It also caused replication<br>
  problems between servers that had the original behavior and<br>
  those that did not, for applications that assigned NULL to NOT<br>
  NULL columns in UPDATE statements without strict SQL mode<br>
  enabled. This change has been reverted so that UPDATE again<br>
  had the original behavior. Problems can still occur if you<br>
  replicate between servers that have the modified UPDATE<br>
  behavior and those that do not.<br>
  (Bug#39265: http://bugs.mysql.com/39265)<br>
<br>
- Important Change: Replication: If a trigger was defined on an<br>
  InnoDB table and this trigger updated a non-transactional<br>
  table, changes performed on the InnoDB table were replicated<br>
  and were visible on the slave before they were committed on<br>
  the master, and were not rolled back on the slave after a<br>
  successful rollback of those changes on the master.<br>
  As a result of the fix for this issue, the semantics of mixing<br>
  non-transactional and transactional tables in a transaction in<br>
  the first statement of a transaction have changed. Previously,<br>
  if the first statement in a transaction contained<br>
  non-transactional changes, the statement was written directly<br>
  to the binary log. Now, any statement appearing after a BEGIN<br>
  (or immediately following a COMMIT if AUTOCOMMIT = 0) is<br>
  always considered part of the transaction and cached. This<br>
  means that non-transactional changes do not propagate to the<br>
  slave until the transaction is committed and thus written to<br>
  the binary log.<br>
  See Section 16.3.1.25, "Replication and Transactions," for<br>
  more information about this change in behavior.<br>
  (Bug#40116: http://bugs.mysql.com/40116)<br>
<br>
- Important Change: Replication: MyISAM transactions replicated<br>
  to a transactional slave left the slave in an unstable<br>
  condition. This was due to the fact that, when replicating<br>
  from a non-transactional storage engine to a transactional<br>
  engine with AUTOCOMMIT turned off, no BEGIN and COMMIT<br>
  statements were written to the binary log; thus, on the slave,<br>
  a never-ending transaction was started.<br>
  The fix for this issue includes enforcing AUTOCOMMIT mode on<br>
  the slave by replicating all AUTOCOMMIT=1 statements from the<br>
  master. (Bug#29288: http://bugs.mysql.com/29288)<br>
