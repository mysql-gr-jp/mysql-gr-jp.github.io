最近、毎月きれいに月初にリリースされて気持ちの良い MySQL 5.1 シリーズです。<br>
<br>
MySQL 5.1.38 がリリースされました。<br>
このリリースは、控えめに言っても「MySQL 5.1 時代の歴史的リリース」 と呼べるかもしれません。<br>
<br>
　最近の MySQL は様々な機能のプラグイン化を進めていますが、今回初めて InnoDB ストレージエンジンを プラグイン化したものをリリースしました。従来の組み込み(ビルトイン)型のInnoDBももちろん含まれています。まだ InnoDBプラグインはベータレベルということですが、これまでの ビルトインInnoDBにはない試みも取り入れられるなど、今後に期待が寄せられます。<br>
<br>
　今後様々なところで InnoDB プラグインの日本語情報も出てくると思いますが、まず詳細は以下のリリースノートをご覧ください。<br>

-----------------------<br>
以下、チェンジログ：<br>
<br>
<br>
■機能の追加と変更(5.1.38)：<br>
* Replication: With statement-based logging (SBL),<br>
  repeatedly calling statements that are unsafe for SBL<br>
  caused a warning message to be written to the error log<br>
  for each statement, and there was no way to disable this<br>
  behavior. Now the server logs messages about statements<br>
  that are unsafe for statement-based logging only if the<br>
  log_warnings variable is greater than 0.<br>
  (Bug#46265: http://bugs.mysql.com/46265)<br>
<br>
* The undocumented TRANSACTIONAL and PAGE_CHECKSUM keywords<br>
  were removed from the grammar.<br>
  (Bug#45829: http://bugs.mysql.com/45829)<br>
<br>
* Previously, SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE dumped column values<br>
  without character set conversion, which could produce<br>
  data files that cannot be imported without error if<br>
  different columns used different character sets. A<br>
  consequence of this is that mysqldump ignored the<br>
  --default-character-set option if the --tab option was<br>
  given (which causes SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE to be used to<br>
  dump data.)<br>
  INTO OUTFILE now can be followed by a CHARACTER SET<br>
  clause indicating the character set to which dumped<br>
  values should be converted. Also, mysqldump adds a<br>
  CHARACTER SET clause to the SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE<br>
  statement used to dump data, so that<br>
  --default-character-set is no longer ignored if --tab is<br>
  given.<br>
  Other changes are that SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE enforces<br>
  that ENCLOSED BY and ESCAPED BY arguments must be a<br>
  single character, and SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE and LOAD<br>
  DATA INFILE produce warnings if non-ASCII field or line<br>
  separators are specified.<br>
  (Bug#30946: http://bugs.mysql.com/30946)<br>
<br>
* The MySQL euckr character set now can store extended<br>
  codes [81...FE][41..5A,61..7A,81..FE], which makes euckr<br>
  compatible with the Microsoft cp949 character set.<br>
<br>
<br>
■バグ修正(5.1.38)：<br>
* Partitioning: Attempting to create a table using an<br>
  invalid or inconsistent subpartition definition caused<br>
  the server to crash. An example of such a statement is<br>
  shown here:<br>
<br>
    CREATE TABLE t2 (s1 INT, s2 INT)<br>
    PARTITION BY LIST (s1) SUBPARTITION BY HASH (s2) SUBPARTITIONS 1<br>
    (<br>
        PARTITION p1 VALUES IN (1),<br>
        PARTITION p2 VALUES IN (2) (SUBPARTITION p3)<br>
    );<br>
<br>
  (Bug#46354: http://bugs.mysql.com/46354)<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: When using a debug build of MySQL, if a<br>
  query against a partitioned table having an index on one<br>
  or more DOUBLE columns used that index, the server failed<br>
  with an assertion.<br>
  (Bug#45816: http://bugs.mysql.com/45816)<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: A failed RENAME TABLE operation on a table<br>
  with user-defined partitioning left the table in an<br>
  unusable state, due to only some of the table files<br>
  having been renamed.<br>
  (Bug#30102: http://bugs.mysql.com/30102)<br>
<br>
* Replication: When a statement that changes a<br>
  non-transactional table failed, the transactional cache<br>
  was flushed, causing a mismatch between the execution and<br>
  logging histories. Now we avoid flushing the<br>
  transactional cache unless a COMMIT or ROLLBACK is<br>
  issued. (Bug#46129: http://bugs.mysql.com/46129)<br>
<br>
* Replication: The internal function<br>
  get_master_version_and_clock() (defined in sql/slave.cc)<br>
  ignored errors and passed directly when queries failed,<br>
  or when queries succeeded but the result retrieved was<br>
  empty. Now this function tries to reconnect the master if<br>
  a query fails due to transient network problems, and to<br>
  fail otherwise. The I/O thread now prints a warning if<br>
  the some system variables do not exist on master (in the<br>
  event the master is a very old version of MySQQL,<br>
  compared to the slave.)<br>
  (Bug#45214: http://bugs.mysql.com/45214)<br>
<br>
* Replication: When using the MIXED logging format, after<br>
  creating a temporary table and performing an update that<br>
  switched the logging format to ROW, the format switch<br>
  persisted following the update. This prevented any<br>
  subsequent DDL statements on temporary tables from being<br>
  written to the binary log until the temporary table was<br>
  dropped. (Bug#43046: http://bugs.mysql.com/43046)<br>
  See also Bug#40013: http://bugs.mysql.com/40013.<br>
  This regression was introduced by<br>
  Bug#20499: http://bugs.mysql.com/20499.<br>
<br>
* Replication: If the --log-bin-trust-function-creators<br>
  option is not enabled, CREATE FUNCTION requires one of<br>
  the modifiers DETERMINISTIC, NO SQL, or READS SQL DATA.<br>
  When using statement-based mode, the execution of a<br>
  stored function should follow the same rules; however,<br>
  only functions defined with DETERMINSTIC could actually<br>
  be executed. In addition, the wrong error was generated<br>
  (ER_BINLOG_ROW_RBR_TO_SBR instead of<br>
  ER_BINLOG_UNSAFE_ROUTINE).<br>
  Now execution of stored functions is compatible with<br>
  creation in this regard; when a stored function without<br>
  one of the modifiers above is executed in STATEMENT mode,<br>
  the correct error is raised, and functions defined using<br>
  NO SQL, READS SQL DATA, or both (that is, without using<br>
  DETERMINSTIC) can be excuted.<br>
  (Bug#41166: http://bugs.mysql.com/41166)<br>
<br>
* The test suite was missing from RPM packages.<br>
  (Bug#46834: http://bugs.mysql.com/46834)<br>
<br>
* Incorrect index optimization could lead to incorrect<br>
  results or server crashes.<br>
  (Bug#46454: http://bugs.mysql.com/46454)<br>
<br>
* The server printed warnings at startup about adjusting<br>
  the value of the max_join_size system variable. (These<br>
  were harmless, but might be seen by users as<br>
  significant.) (Bug#46385: http://bugs.mysql.com/46385)<br>
<br>
* After an error such as a table-full condition, INSERT<br>
  IGNORE could cause an assertion failure for debug builds.<br>
  (Bug#46075: http://bugs.mysql.com/46075)<br>
<br>
* An optimization that moved an item from a subquery to an<br>
  outer query could cause a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#46051: http://bugs.mysql.com/46051)<br>
<br>
* Several Valgrind warnings were corrected.<br>
  (Bug#46003: http://bugs.mysql.com/46003,<br>
  Bug#46034: http://bugs.mysql.com/46034,<br>
  Bug#46042: http://bugs.mysql.com/46042)<br>
<br>
* CREATE TABLE ... SELECT could cause a server crash if no<br>
  default database was selected.<br>
  (Bug#45998: http://bugs.mysql.com/45998)<br>
<br>
* For problems reading SSL files during SSL initialization,<br>
  the server wrote error messages to stderr rather than to<br>
  the error log. (Bug#45770: http://bugs.mysql.com/45770)<br>
<br>
* The vendor name change from MySQL AB to Sun Microsystems,<br>
  Inc. in RPM packages was not handled gracefully when<br>
  upgrading MySQL using an RPM package.<br>
  (Bug#45534: http://bugs.mysql.com/45534)<br>
<br>
* A Windows Installation using the GUI installer would fail<br>
  with:<br>
<br>
    MySQL Server 5.1 Setup Wizard ended prematurely<br>
<br>
    The wizard was interrupted before MySQL Server 5.1. could be<br>
    completely installed.<br>
<br>
    Your system has not been modified. To complete installation at<br>
    another time, please run setup again.<br>
<br>
    Click Finish to exit the wizard<br>
<br>
  This was due to an step in the MSI installer that could<br>
  fail to execute correctly on some environments.<br>
  (Bug#45418: http://bugs.mysql.com/45418)<br>
<br>
* Invalid memory reads could occur using the compressed<br>
  client/server protocol.<br>
  (Bug#45031: http://bugs.mysql.com/45031)<br>
<br>
* The mysql_real_connect() C API function only attempted to<br>
  connect to the first IP address returned for a hostname.<br>
  This could be a problem if a hostname mapped to multiple<br>
  IP address and the server was not bound to the first one<br>
  returned. Now mysql_real_connect() attempts to connect to<br>
  all IPv4/6 addresses that a domain name maps to.<br>
  (Bug#45017: http://bugs.mysql.com/45017)<br>
<br>
* Invalid input could cause invalid memory reads by the<br>
  parser. (Bug#45010: http://bugs.mysql.com/45010)<br>
<br>
* Some files in an AIX tar file distribution unpacked with<br>
  incorrect permissions.<br>
  (Bug#44647: http://bugs.mysql.com/44647)<br>
<br>
* For debug builds, executing a stored procedure as a<br>
  prepared statement could sometimes cause an assertion<br>
  failure. (Bug#44521: http://bugs.mysql.com/44521)<br>
<br>
* Using mysql_stmt_execute() to call a stored procedure<br>
  could cause a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#44495: http://bugs.mysql.com/44495)<br>
<br>
* Creating a new instance after previously removing an<br>
  instance would fail to complete the installation properly<br>
  because the security settings could not be applied<br>
  correctly. (Bug#44428: http://bugs.mysql.com/44428)<br>
<br>
* mysqlslap ignored the --csv option if it was given<br>
  without an argument.<br>
  (Bug#44412: http://bugs.mysql.com/44412)<br>
<br>
* Enabling the event scheduler from within the file<br>
  specified by --init-file caused a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#43587: http://bugs.mysql.com/43587)<br>
<br>
* The server did not always check the return value of calls<br>
  to the hash_init() function.<br>
  (Bug#43572: http://bugs.mysql.com/43572)<br>
<br>
* The table cache lock (LOCK_open) is now an adaptive<br>
  mutex, which should improve performance in workloads<br>
  where this lock is heavily contended.<br>
  (Bug#43435: http://bugs.mysql.com/43435)<br>
<br>
* mysqladmin --count=X --sleep=Y incorrectly delayed Y<br>
  seconds after the last iteration before exiting.<br>
  (Bug#42639: http://bugs.mysql.com/42639)<br>
<br>
* A test for stack growth failed on some platforms, leading<br>
  to server crashes.<br>
  (Bug#42213: http://bugs.mysql.com/42213)<br>
<br>
* mysqladmin did not have enough space allocated for<br>
  tracking all variables when using --vertical or<br>
  --relative with extended-status.<br>
  (Bug#40395: http://bugs.mysql.com/40395)<br>
<br>
* Partitioning a log table caused a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#40281: http://bugs.mysql.com/40281)<br>
<br>
* When using quick access methods to search for rows in<br>
  UPDATE and DELETE statements, there was no check whether<br>
  a fatal error had already been sent to the client while<br>
  evaluating the quick condition. Consequently, a false OK<br>
  (following the error) was sent to the client, causing the<br>
  error to be incorrectly transformed into a warning.<br>
  (Bug#40113: http://bugs.mysql.com/40113)<br>
<br>
* SHOW PROCESSLIST could access freed memory of a stored<br>
  procedure run in a concurrent session.<br>
  (Bug#38816: http://bugs.mysql.com/38816)<br>
<br>
* During installation on Windows, the MySQL Instance<br>
  Configuration Wizard window could be opened at a size too<br>
  small to be usable.<br>
  (Bug#38723: http://bugs.mysql.com/38723)<br>
<br>
* make_binary_distribution did not always generate correct<br>
  distribution names.<br>
  (Bug#37808: http://bugs.mysql.com/37808)<br>
<br>
* The server crashed when executing a prepared statement<br>
  containing a duplicated MATCH() function call in the<br>
  select list and ORDER BY clause; for example, SELECT<br>
  MATCH(a) AGAINST('test') FROM t1 ORDER BY MATCH(a)<br>
  AGAINST('test'). (Bug#37740: http://bugs.mysql.com/37740)<br>
<br>
* The output of mysqldump --tab for views included a DROP<br>
  TABLE statement without the IF EXISTS qualifier.<br>
  (Bug#37377: http://bugs.mysql.com/37377)<br>
<br>
* mysql_upgrade silently ignored the --basedir and<br>
  --datadir options, which it accepts for backward<br>
  compatibility. Now it prints a warning.<br>
  (Bug#36558: http://bugs.mysql.com/36558)<br>
<br>
* mysqlimport was not always compiled correctly to enable<br>
  thread support, which is required for the --use-threads<br>
  option. (Bug#32991: http://bugs.mysql.com/32991)<br>
<br>
* mysqlcheck failed to fix table names when the<br>
  --fix-table-names and --all-in-1 options were both<br>
  specified. (Bug#31821: http://bugs.mysql.com/31821)<br>
<br>
* If the MySQL server was killed without the PID file being<br>
  removed, attempts to stop the server with mysql.server<br>
  stop waited 900 seconds before giving up.<br>
  (Bug#31785: http://bugs.mysql.com/31785)<br>
<br>
* When performing an installation on Windows using the GUI<br>
  installer, the installer would fail to wait long enough<br>
  during installation for the MySQL service to be<br>
  installed, which would cause the installation to fail and<br>
  may cause security settings, such as the root password to<br>
  not be applied correctly.<br>
  (Bug#30525: http://bugs.mysql.com/30525)<br>
<br>
* mysql included extra spaces at the end of some result set<br>
  lines. (Bug#29622: http://bugs.mysql.com/29622)<br>
<br>
* The mysql client inconsistently handled NUL bytes in<br>
  column data in various output formats.<br>
  (Bug#28203: http://bugs.mysql.com/28203)<br>
<br>
* mysqlimport did not correctly quote and escape table<br>
  identifiers and file names.<br>
  (Bug#28071: http://bugs.mysql.com/28071)<br>
<br>
* When installing the Windows service, using quotes around<br>
  command-line configuration parameters could cause the<br>
  quotes to incorrectly placed around the entire<br>
  command-line option, and not just the value.<br>
  (Bug#27535: http://bugs.mysql.com/27535)<br>
<br>
* If the mysql client was built with the readline library<br>
  and the .inputrc file mapped Space to the magic-space<br>
  function, it became impossible to enter spaces.<br>
  (Bug#27439: http://bugs.mysql.com/27439)<br>
<br>
* If InnoDB reached its limit on the number of concurrent<br>
  transactions (1023), it wrote a descriptive message to<br>
  the error log but returned a misleading error message to<br>
  the client, or an assertion failure occurred.<br>
  (Bug#18828: http://bugs.mysql.com/18828)<br>
