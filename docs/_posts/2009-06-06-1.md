以下チェンジログ(5.1.35):<br>
■Windows版には以下２つの未解決の問題が含まれています:<br>
   * The .msi installer does not detect an existing root password<br>
     on the initial configuration attempt. To work around this,<br>
     install and configure MySQL as normal, but skip any changes to<br>
     security. (There is a checkbox that allows this on the<br>
     security screen of the configuration wizard.) Then check your<br>
     settings:<br>
<br>
        + If the old root password and security settings are okay,<br>
          you are done and can proceed to use MySQL.<br>
<br>
        + Otherwise, reconfigure with the wizard and make any<br>
          changes on the second configuration attempt. The wizard<br>
          will properly prompt for the existing root password and<br>
          allow changes to be made.<br>
<br>
     This issue has been filed as<br>
     Bug#45200: http://bugs.mysql.com/45200 for correction in a<br>
     future release.<br>
<br>
<br>
   * The Windows configuration wizard allows changes to InnoDB<br>
     settings during a reconfiguration operation. For an upgrade,<br>
     this may cause difficulties. To work around this, use one of<br>
     the following alternatives:<br>
        + Do not change InnoDB settings.<br>
        + Copy files from the old InnoDB location to the new one.<br>

■バグ修正(5.1.35):<br>
   * Important Change: Replication: The transactional behavior of<br>
     STOP SLAVE has changed. Formerly, it took effect immediately,<br>
     even inside a transaction; now, it waits until the current<br>
     replication event group (if any) has finished executing, or<br>
     until the user issues a KILL QUERY or KILL CONNECTION<br>
     statement.<br>
<br>
     This was done in order to solve the problem encountered when<br>
     replication was stopped while a nontransactional slave was<br>
     replicating a transaction on the master. (It was impossible to<br>
     roll back a mixed-engines transaction when one of the engines<br>
     was nontransactional, which meant that the slave could not<br>
     safely re-apply any transaction that had been interrupted by<br>
     STOP SLAVE.) (Bug#319: http://bugs.mysql.com/319,<br>
     Bug#38205: http://bugs.mysql.com/38205)<br>
     See also Bug#43217: http://bugs.mysql.com/43217.<br>
<br>
   * Partitioning: When a value was equal to a PARTITION ... VALUES<br>
     LESS THAN (value) value other than MAXVALUE, the corresponding<br>
     partition was not pruned.<br>
     (Bug#42944: http://bugs.mysql.com/42944)<br>
<br>
   * Replication: Unrelated errors occurring during the execution<br>
     of RESET SLAVE could cause the slave to crash.<br>
     (Bug#44179: http://bugs.mysql.com/44179)<br>
<br>
   * Replication: The --slave-skip-errors option had no effect when<br>
     using row-based logging format.<br>
     (Bug#39393: http://bugs.mysql.com/39393)<br>
<br>
   * Replication: The following erors were not correctly reported:<br>
<br>
        + Failures during slave thread initialization<br>
<br>
        + Failures while initializing the relay log position<br>
          (immediately following the starting of the slave thread)<br>
<br>
        + Failures while processing queries passed through the<br>
          --init_slave option.<br>
<br>
     Information about these types of failures can now be found in<br>
     the output of SHOW SLAVE STATUS.<br>
     (Bug#38197: http://bugs.mysql.com/38197)<br>
<br>
   * Replication: Killing the thread executing a DDL statement,<br>
     after it had finished its execution but before it had written<br>
     the binlog event, caused the error code in the binlog event to<br>
     be set (incorrectly) to ER_SERVER_SHUTDOWN or<br>
     ER_QUERY_INTERRUPTED, which caused replication to fail.<br>
     (Bug#37145: http://bugs.mysql.com/37145)<br>
<br>
     See also Bug#27571: http://bugs.mysql.com/27571,<br>
     Bug#22725: http://bugs.mysql.com/22725.<br>
<br>
   * Replication: Column alises used inside subqueries were ignored<br>
     in the binary log. (Bug#35515: http://bugs.mysql.com/35515)<br>
<br>
   * Valgrind warnings for the DECODE(), ENCRYPT(), and<br>
     FIND_IN_SET() functions were corrected.<br>
     (Bug#44358: http://bugs.mysql.com/44358,<br>
     Bug#44365: http://bugs.mysql.com/44365,<br>
     Bug#44367: http://bugs.mysql.com/44367)<br>
<br>
   * On Windows, entries for build-vs9.bat and build-vs9_x64.bat<br>
     were missing in win/Makefile.am.<br>
     (Bug#44353: http://bugs.mysql.com/44353)<br>
<br>
   * Incomplete cleanup of JOIN_TAB::select during the filesort of<br>
     rows for a GROUP BY clause inside a subquery caused a server<br>
     crash. (Bug#44290: http://bugs.mysql.com/44290)<br>
<br>
   * Not all lock types had proper descriptive strings, resulting<br>
     in garbage output from mysqladmin debug.<br>
     (Bug#44164: http://bugs.mysql.com/44164)<br>
<br>
   * Use of HANDLER statements with INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables<br>
     caused a server crash. Now HANDLER is prohibited with such<br>
     tables. (Bug#44151: http://bugs.mysql.com/44151)<br>
<br>
   * Invoking SHOW TABLE STATUS from within a stored procedure<br>
     could cause a Packets out of order error.<br>
     (Bug#43962: http://bugs.mysql.com/43962)<br>
<br>
   * myisamchk could display a negative Max keyfile length value.<br>
     (Bug#43950: http://bugs.mysql.com/43950)<br>
<br>
   * On 64-bit systems, a key_buffer_size value larger than 4GB<br>
     could couse MyISAM index corruption.<br>
     (Bug#43932: http://bugs.mysql.com/43932)<br>
<br>
   * mysqld_multi incorrectly passed --no-defaults to mysqld_safe.<br>
     (Bug#43876: http://bugs.mysql.com/43876)<br>
<br>
   * SHOW VARIABLES did not properly display the value of<br>
     slave_skip_errors. (Bug#43835: http://bugs.mysql.com/43835)<br>
<br>
   * On Windows, a server crash occurred for attempts to insert a<br>
     floating-point value into a CHAR column with a maximum length<br>
     less than the converted floating-point value length.<br>
     (Bug#43833: http://bugs.mysql.com/43833)<br>
<br>
   * Incorrect initialization of MyISAM table indexes could cause<br>
     incorrect query results.<br>
     (Bug#43737: http://bugs.mysql.com/43737)<br>
<br>
   * libmysqld crashed when it was reinitialized.<br>
     (Bug#43706: http://bugs.mysql.com/43706,<br>
     Bug#44091: http://bugs.mysql.com/44091)<br>
<br>
   * InnoDB uses random numbers to generate dives into indexes for<br>
     calculating index cardinality. However, under certain<br>
     conditions, the algorithm did not generate random numbers, so<br>
     ANALYZE TABLE did not update cardinality estimates properly. A<br>
     new algorithm has been introduced with better randomization<br>
     properties, together with a system variable,<br>
     innodb_use_legacy_cardinality_algorithm, that controls which<br>
     algorithm to use. The default value of the variable is 1 (ON),<br>
     to use the original algorithm for compatibility with existing<br>
     applications. The variable can be set to 0 (OFF) to use the<br>
     new algorithm with improved randomness.<br>
     (Bug#43660: http://bugs.mysql.com/43660)<br>
<br>
   * UNION of floating-point numbers did unnecessary rounding.<br>
     (Bug#43432: http://bugs.mysql.com/43432)<br>
<br>
   * ALTER DATABASE ... UPGRADE DATA DIRECTORY NAME failed when the<br>
     database contained views.<br>
     (Bug#43385: http://bugs.mysql.com/43385)<br>
<br>
   * Certain statements might open a table and then wait for an<br>
     impending global read lock without noticing whether they hold<br>
     a table being waiting for by the global read lock, causing a<br>
     hang. Affected statements are SELECT ... FOR UPDATE, LOCK<br>
     TABLES ... WRITE, TRUNCATE TABLE, and LOAD DATA INFILE.<br>
     (Bug#43230: http://bugs.mysql.com/43230)<br>
<br>
   * Using an XML function such as ExtractValue() more than once in<br>
     a single query could produce erroneous results.<br>
     (Bug#43183: http://bugs.mysql.com/43183)<br>
     See also Bug#43937: http://bugs.mysql.com/43937.<br>
<br>
   * Full-text prefix searches could hang the connection and cause<br>
     100% CPU consumption. (Bug#42907: http://bugs.mysql.com/42907)<br>
<br>
   * InnoDB had excessive contention for a character set mutex.<br>
     (Bug#42649: http://bugs.mysql.com/42649)<br>
<br>
   * Incorrect elevation of warning messages to error messages for<br>
     unsafe statements caused a server crash.<br>
     (Bug#42640: http://bugs.mysql.com/42640)<br>
<br>
   * CHECK TABLE suggested use of REPAIR TABLE for corrupt tables<br>
     for storage engines not supported by REPAIR TABLE. Now CHECK<br>
     TABLE suggests that the user dump and reload the table.<br>
     (Bug#42563: http://bugs.mysql.com/42563)<br>
<br>
   * Compressing a table with the myisampack utility caused the<br>
     server to produce Valgrind warnings when it opened the table.<br>
     (Bug#41541: http://bugs.mysql.com/41541)<br>
<br>
   * For a MyISAM table with DELAY_KEY_WRITE enabled, the index<br>
     file could be corrupted without the table being marked as<br>
     crashed if the server was killed.<br>
     (Bug#41330: http://bugs.mysql.com/41330)<br>
<br>
   * Killing an INSERT ... SELECT statement for a MyISAM table<br>
     could cause table corruption if the table had indexes.<br>
     (Bug#40827: http://bugs.mysql.com/40827)<br>
<br>
   * A multiple-table DELETE IGNORE statement involving a foreign<br>
     key constraint caused an assertion failure.<br>
     (Bug#40127: http://bugs.mysql.com/40127)<br>
<br>
   * Multiple-table UPDATE statements did not properly activate<br>
     triggers. (Bug#39953: http://bugs.mysql.com/39953)<br>
<br>
   * The mysql_setpermission operation for removing database<br>
     privileges removed global privileges instead.<br>
     (Bug#39852: http://bugs.mysql.com/39852)<br>
<br>
   * A stored routine contain a C-style comment could not be dumped<br>
     and reloaded. (Bug#39559: http://bugs.mysql.com/39559)<br>
<br>
   * In an UPDATE or DELETE via a secondary index, InnoDB did not<br>
     store the cursor position. This made InnoDB crash in<br>
     semi-consistent read while attempting to unlock a nonmatching<br>
     record. (Bug#39320: http://bugs.mysql.com/39320)<br>
<br>
   * The functions listed in Section 11.13.4.2.3, "Creating<br>
     Geometry Values Using MySQL-Specific Functions," previously<br>
     accepted WKB arguments and returned WKB values. They now<br>
     accept WKB or geometry arguments and return geometry values.<br>
     The functions listed in Section 11.13.4.2.2, "Creating<br>
     Geometry Values Using WKB Functions," previously accepted WKB<br>
     arguments and returned geometry values. They now accept WKB or<br>
     geometry arguments and return geometry values.<br>
     (Bug#38990: http://bugs.mysql.com/38990)<br>
<br>
   * On WIndows, running the server with myisam_use_mmap enabled<br>
     caused MyISAM table corruption.<br>
     (Bug#38848: http://bugs.mysql.com/38848)<br>
<br>
   * CHECK TABLE did not properly check whether MyISAM tables<br>
     created by servers from MySQL 4.0 or older needed to be<br>
     upgraded. This could cause problems upgrading to MySQL 5.1 or<br>
     higher. (Bug#37631: http://bugs.mysql.com/37631)<br>
<br>
   * An UPDATE statement that updated a column using the same<br>
     DES_ENCRYPT() value for each row actually updated different<br>
     rows with different values.<br>
     (Bug#35087: http://bugs.mysql.com/35087)<br>
<br>
   * For shared-memory connections, the read and write methods did<br>
     not properly handle asynchronous close events, which could<br>
     lead to the client locking up waiting for a server response.<br>
     For example, a call to mysql_real_query() would block forever<br>
     on the client side if the executed statement was aborted on<br>
     the server side. Thanks to Armin Schöffmann for the bug report<br>
     and patch. (Bug#33899: http://bugs.mysql.com/33899)<br>
<br>
   * CHECKSUM TABLE was not killable with KILL QUERY.<br>
     (Bug#33146: http://bugs.mysql.com/33146)<br>
<br>
   * myisamchk and myisampack were not being linked with the<br>
     library that enabled support for * filename pattern expansion.<br>
     (Bug#29248: http://bugs.mysql.com/29248)<br>
<br>
   * For InnoDB tables that have their own .ibd tablespace file, a<br>
     superfluous ibuf cursor restoration fails! message could be<br>
     written to the error log. This warning has been suppressed.<br>
     (Bug#27276: http://bugs.mysql.com/27276)<br>
<br>
   * COMMIT did not delete savepoints if there were no changes in<br>
     the transaction. (Bug#26288: http://bugs.mysql.com/26288)<br>
<br>
   * Several memory allocation functions were not being checked for<br>
     out-of-memory return values.<br>
     (Bug#25058: http://bugs.mysql.com/25058)<br>
