<br>
■InnoDB Plugin に関する情報：<br>
* This release includes InnoDB Plugin 1.0.6. This version is<br>
  considered of Release Candidate (RC) quality.<br>
  In this release, the InnoDB Plugin is included in source and<br>
  binary distributions, except RHEL3, RHEL4, SuSE 9 (x86,<br>
  x86_64, ia64), and generic Linux RPM packages. It also does<br>
  not work for FreeBSD 6 and HP-UX or for Linux on generic ia64.<br>
<br>
■機能の追加と変更：<br>
* Replication: Introduced the<br>
  --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates server option. This<br>
  option causes updates using the statement-based logging format<br>
  to tables using non-transactional engines to be written<br>
  directly to the binary log, rather than to the transaction<br>
  cache.<br>
  Before using this option, be certain that you have no<br>
  dependencies between transactional and non-transactional<br>
  tables. A statement that both selects from an InnoDB table and<br>
  inserts into a MyISAM table is an example of such a<br>
  dependency. For more information, see Section 16.1.3.4,<br>
  "Binary Log Options and Variables."<br>

■バグ修正：<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: When an ALTER TABLE ... REORGANIZE PARTITION<br>
  statement on an InnoDB table failed due to<br>
  innodb_lock_wait_timeout expiring while waiting for a lock,<br>
  InnoDB did not clean up any temporary files or tables which it<br>
  had created. Attempting to reissue the ALTER TABLE statement<br>
  following the timeout could lead to storage engine errors, or<br>
  possibly a crash of the server.<br>
  (Bug#47343: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47343)<br>
<br>
* Replication: In some cases, inserting into a table with many<br>
  columns could cause the binary log to become corrupted.<br>
  (Bug#50018: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50018)<br>
  See also Bug#42749: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=42749.<br>
<br>
* Replication: When using row-based replication, setting a BIT<br>
  or CHAR column of a MyISAM table to NULL, then trying to<br>
  delete from the table, caused the slave to fail with the error<br>
  Can't find record in table.<br>
  (Bug#49481: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49481,<br>
  Bug#49482: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49482)<br>
<br>
* Replication: When logging in row-based mode, DDL statements<br>
  are actually logged as statements; however, statements that<br>
  affected temporary tables and followed DDL statements failed<br>
  to reset the binary log format to ROW, with the result that<br>
  these statements were logged using the statement-based format.<br>
  Now the state of binlog_format is restored after a DDL<br>
  statement has been written to the binary log.<br>
  (Bug#49132: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49132)<br>
<br>
* Replication: When using row-based logging, the statement<br>
  CREATE TABLE t IF NOT EXIST ... SELECT was logged as CREATE<br>
  TEMPORARY TABLE t IF NOT EXIST ... SELECT when t already<br>
  existed as a temporary table. This was caused by the fact that<br>
  the temporary table was opened and the results of the SELECT<br>
  were inserted into it when a temporary table existed and had<br>
  the same name.<br>
  Now, when this statement is executed, t is created as a base<br>
  table, the results of the SELECT are inserted into it --- even<br>
  if there already exists a temporary table having the same name<br>
  --- and the statement is logged correctly.<br>
  (Bug#47418: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47418)<br>
  See also Bug#47442: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47442.<br>
<br>
* Replication: Due to a change in the size of event<br>
  representations in the binary log, when replicating from a<br>
  MySQL 4.1 master to a slave running MySQL 5.0.60 or later, the<br>
  START SLAVE UNTIL statement did not function correctly,<br>
  stopping at the wrong position in the log. Now the slave<br>
  detects that the master is using the older version of the<br>
  binary log format, and corrects for the difference in event<br>
  size, so that the slave stops in the correct position.<br>
  (Bug#47142: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47142)<br>
<br>
* The SSL certificates in the test suite were about to expire.<br>
  They have been updated with expiration dates in the year 2015.<br>
  (Bug#50642: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50642)<br>
<br>
* The printstack function does not exist on Solaris 8 or<br>
  earlier, which would lead to a compilation failure.<br>
  (Bug#50409: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50409)<br>
<br>
* A user could see tables in INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES without<br>
  appropriate privileges for them.<br>
  (Bug#50276: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50276)<br>
<br>
* Debug output for join structures was garbled.<br>
  (Bug#50271: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50271)<br>
<br>
* The filesort sorting method applied to a CHAR(0) column could<br>
  lead to a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#49897: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49897)<br>
<br>
* sql_buffer_result had an effect on non-SELECT statements,<br>
  contrary to the documentation.<br>
  (Bug#49552: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49552)<br>
<br>
* In some cases a subquery need not be evaluated because it<br>
  returns only aggregate values that can be calculated from<br>
  table metadata. This sometimes was not handled by the<br>
  enclosing subquery, resulting in a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#49512: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49512)<br>
<br>
* The method for comparing INFORMATION_SCHEMA names and database<br>
  names was nonoptimal and an improvement was made: When the<br>
  database name length is already known, a length check is made<br>
  first and content comparison skipped if the lengths are<br>
  unequal. (Bug#49501: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49501)<br>
<br>
* The MD5() and SHA1() functions had excessive overhead for<br>
  short strings.<br>
  (Bug#49491: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49491)<br>
<br>
* Mixing full-text searches and row expressions caused a crash.<br>
  (Bug#49445: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49445)<br>
<br>
* Creating or dropping a table with 1023 transactions active<br>
  caused an assertion failure.<br>
  (Bug#49238: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49238)<br>
<br>
* mysql-test-run.pl now recognizes the MTR_TESTCASE_TIMEOUT,<br>
  MTR_SUITE_TIMEOUT, MTR_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT, and MTR_START_TIMEOUT<br>
  environment variables. If they are set, their values are used<br>
  to set the --testcase-timeout, --suite-timeout,<br>
  --shutdown-timeout, and --start-timeout options, respectively.<br>
