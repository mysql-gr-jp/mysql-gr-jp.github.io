<br>
■機能の追加と変更(5.1.29-rc)：<br>
- Important Change: The --skip-thread-priority option is now<br>
  deprecated in MySQL 5.1 and is removed in MySQL 6.0 such that<br>
  the server won't change the thread priorities by default.<br>
<br>
  Giving threads different priorities might yield marginal<br>
  improvements in some platforms (where it actually works), but<br>
  it might instead cause significant degradation depending on<br>
  the thread count and number of processors. Meddling with the<br>
  thread priorities is a not a safe bet as it is very dependent<br>
  on the behavior of the CPU scheduler and system where MySQL is<br>
  being run.<br>
  (Bug#35164: http://bugs.mysql.com/35164,<br>
   Bug#37536: http://bugs.mysql.com/37536)<br>
<br>
- Important Change: The --log option now is deprecated and will<br>
  be removed (along with the log system variable) in the future.<br>
  Instead, use the --general_log option to enable the general<br>
  query log and the --general_log_file=file_name option to set<br>
  the general query log filename. The values of these options<br>
  are available in the general_log and general_log_file system<br>
  variables, which can be changed at runtime.<br>
<br>
  Similar changes were made for the --log-slow-queries option<br>
  and log_slow_queries system variable. You should use the<br>
  --slow_query_log and --slow_query_log_file=file_name options<br>
  instead (and the slow_query_log and slow_query_log_file system<br>
  variables).<br>
<br>
- The SHOW PROFILES and SHOW PROFILE statements were added to<br>
  display statement profile data, and the accompanying<br>
  "INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROFILING" table. Profiling is controlled<br>
  via the 'profiling' and 'profiling_history_size' session<br>
  variables. (Community contribution by Jeremy Cole)<br>
<br>
- The BUILD/compile-solaris-* scripts now compile MySQL with the<br>
  mtmalloc library rather than malloc.<br>
  (Bug#38727: http://bugs.mysql.com/38727)<br>
<br>
<br>
■バグ修正(5.1.29-rc)：<br>
- Incompatible Change: Replication: The default binary logging<br>
  mode has been changed from MIXED to STATEMENT for<br>
  compatibility with MySQL 5.0.<br>
  (Bug#39812: http://bugs.mysql.com/39812)<br>
<br>
- Incompatible Change: In connection with view creation, the<br>
  server created arc directories inside database directories and<br>
  maintained useless copies of .frm files there. Creation and<br>
  renaming procedures of those copies as well as creation of arc<br>
  directories has been discontinued.<br>
<br>
  This change does cause a problem when downgrading to older<br>
  server versions which manifests itself under these<br>
  circumstances:<br>
<br>
    1. Create a view v_orig in MySQL 5.1.29 or higher.<br>
    2. Rename the view to v_new and then back to v_orig.<br>
    3. Downgrade to an older 5.1.x server and run mysql_upgrade.<br>
    4. Try to rename v_orig to v_new again. This operation<br>
       fails.<br>
<br>
  As a workaround to avoid this problem, use either of these<br>
  approaches:<br>
     + Dump your data using mysqldump before downgrading and<br>
       reload the dump file after downgrading.<br>
     + Instead of renaming a view after the downgrade, drop it<br>
       and recreate it.<br>

<br>
- Important Change: Replication: The SUPER privilege is now<br>
  required to change the session value of binlog_format as well<br>
  as its global value. For more information about binlog_format,<br>
  see Section 15.1.2, "Replication Formats."<br>
  (Bug#39106: http://bugs.mysql.com/39106)<br>
<br>
- Partitioning: Replication: Replication to partitioned MyISAM<br>
  tables could be slow with row-based binary logging.<br>
  (Bug#35843: http://bugs.mysql.com/35843)<br>
<br>
- Partitioning: If an error occurred when evaluating a column of<br>
  a partitioned table for the partitioning function, the row<br>
  could be inserted anyway.<br>
  (Bug#38083: http://bugs.mysql.com/38083)<br>
<br>
- Partitioning: Using INSERT ... SELECT to insert records into a<br>
  partitioned MyISAM table could fail if some partitions were<br>
  empty and others are not.<br>
  (Bug#38005: http://bugs.mysql.com/38005)<br>
<br>
- Partitioning: Ordered range scans on partitioned tables were<br>
  not always handled correctly. In some cases this caused some<br>
  rows to be returned twice. The same issue also caused GROUP BY<br>
  query results to be aggregated incorrectly.<br>
  (Bug#30573: http://bugs.mysql.com/30573,<br>
   Bug#33257: http://bugs.mysql.com/33257,<br>
   Bug#33555: http://bugs.mysql.com/33555)<br>
<br>
- Replication: Server code used in binary logging could in some<br>
  cases be invoked even though binary logging was not actually<br>
  enabled, leading to asserts and other server errors.<br>
  (Bug#38798: http://bugs.mysql.com/38798)<br>
<br>
- Replication: Replication of BLACKHOLE tables did not work with<br>
  row-based binary logging.<br>
  (Bug#38360: http://bugs.mysql.com/38360)<br>
<br>
- Replication: In some cases, a replication master sent a<br>
  special event to a reconnecting slave to keep the slave's<br>
  temporary tables, but they still had references to the "old"<br>
  slave SQL thread and used them to access that thread's data.<br>
  (Bug#38269: http://bugs.mysql.com/38269)<br>
<br>
- Replication: Replication filtering rules were inappropiately<br>
  applied when executing BINLOG pseudo-queries. One way in which<br>
  this problem showed itself was that, when replaying a binary<br>
  log with mysqlbinlog, RBR events were sometimes not executed<br>
  if the --replicate-do-db option was specified. Now replication<br>
  rules are applied only to those events executed by the slave<br>
  SQL thread.<br>
  (Bug#36099: http://bugs.mysql.com/36099)<br>
<br>
- Replication: For a CREATE TABLE ... SELECT statement that<br>
  creates a table in a database other than the current one, the<br>
  table could be created in the wrong database on replication<br>
  slaves if row-based binary logging is used.<br>
  (Bug#34707: http://bugs.mysql.com/34707)<br>
<br>
- Replication: A statement did not always commit or roll back<br>
  correctly when the server was shut down; the error could be<br>
  triggered by having a failing UPDATE or INSERT statement on a<br>
  transactional table, causing an implicit rollback.<br>
  (Bug#32709: http://bugs.mysql.com/32709)<br>
  See also Bug#38262: http://bugs.mysql.com/38262<br>
<br>
- CHECK TABLE ... FOR UPGRADE did not check for incompatible<br>
  collation changes made in MySQL 5.0.48.<br>
  (Bug#39585: http://bugs.mysql.com/39585)<br>
<br>
- The Sun Studio compiler failed to build debug versions of the<br>
  server due to use of features specific to gcc.<br>
  (Bug#39451: http://bugs.mysql.com/39451)<br>
<br>
- For a TIMESTAMP column in an InnoDB table, testing the column<br>
  with multiple conditions in the WHERE clause caused a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#39353: http://bugs.mysql.com/39353)<br>
<br>
- References to local variables in stored procedures are<br>
  replaced with NAME_CONST(name, value) when written to the<br>
  binary log. However, an "illegal mix of collation" error might<br>
  occur when executing the log contents if the value's collation<br>
  differed from that of the variable. Now information about the<br>
  variable collation is written as well.<br>
  (Bug#39182: http://bugs.mysql.com/39182)<br>
<br>
- Queries of the form SELECT ... REGEXP BINARY NULL could lead<br>
  to a hung or crashed server.<br>
  (Bug#39021: http://bugs.mysql.com/39021)<br>
<br>
- Statements of the form INSERT ... SELECT .. ON DUPLICATE KEY<br>
  UPDATE col_name = DEFAULT could result in a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#39002: http://bugs.mysql.com/39002)<br>
<br>
- Column names constructed due to wild-card expansion done<br>
  inside a stored procedure could point to freed memory if the<br>
  expansion was performed after the first call to the stored<br>
  procedure. (Bug#38823: http://bugs.mysql.com/38823)<br>
<br>
- Repeated CREATE TABLE ... SELECT statements, where the created<br>
  table contained an AUTO_INCREMENT column, could lead to an<br>
  assertion failure. (Bug#38821: http://bugs.mysql.com/38821)<br>
<br>
- For deadlock between two transactions that required a timeout<br>
  to resolve, all server tables became inaccessible for the<br>
  duration of the deadlock.<br>
  (Bug#38804: http://bugs.mysql.com/38804)<br>
<br>
- When inserting a string into a duplicate-key error message,<br>
  the server could improperly interpret the string, resulting in<br>
  a crash. (Bug#38701: http://bugs.mysql.com/38701)<br>
<br>
- A race condition between threads sometimes caused unallocated<br>
  memory to be addressed.<br>
  (Bug#38692: http://bugs.mysql.com/38692)<br>
<br>
- A server crash resulted from concurrent execution of a<br>
  multiple-table UPDATE that used a NATURAL or USING join<br>
  together with FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK or ALTER TABLE for<br>
  the table being updated.<br>
  (Bug#38691: http://bugs.mysql.com/38691)<br>
<br>
- On ActiveState Perl, mysql-test-run.pl --start-and-exit<br>
  started but did not exit.<br>
  (Bug#38629: http://bugs.mysql.com/38629)<br>
<br>
- An uninitialized variable in the query profiling code was<br>
  corrected (detected by Valgrind).<br>
  (Bug#38560: http://bugs.mysql.com/38560)<br>
<br>
- A server crash resulted from execution of an UPDATE that used<br>
  a derived table together with FLUSH TABLES.<br>
  (Bug#38499: http://bugs.mysql.com/38499)<br>
<br>
- Stored procedures involving substrings could crash the server<br>
  on certain platforms due to invalid memory reads.<br>
  (Bug#38469: http://bugs.mysql.com/38469)<br>
<br>
- The handlerton-to-plugin mapping implementation did not free<br>
  handler plugin references when the plugin was uninstalled,<br>
  resulting in a server crash after several install/uninstall<br>
  cycles. Also, on Mac OS X, the server crashed when trying to<br>
  access an EXAMPLE table after the EXAMPLE plugin was<br>
  installed.<br>
  (Bug#37958: http://bugs.mysql.com/37958)<br>
<br>
- The server crashed if an argument to a stored procedure was a<br>
  subquery that returned more than one row.<br>
  (Bug#37949: http://bugs.mysql.com/37949)<br>
<br>
- When analyzing the possible index use cases, the server was<br>
  incorrectly reusing an internal structure, leading to a server<br>
  crash.<br>
  (Bug#37943: http://bugs.mysql.com/37943)<br>
<br>
- Access checks were skipped for SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS and SHOW<br>
  FUNCTION STATUS, which could lead to a server crash or<br>
  insufficient access checks in subsequent statements.<br>
  (Bug#37908: http://bugs.mysql.com/37908)<br>
<br>
- The <=> operator could return incorrect results when comparing<br>
  NULL to DATE, TIME, or DATETIME values.<br>
  (Bug#37526: http://bugs.mysql.com/37526)<br>
<br>
- The combination of a subquery with a GROUP BY, an aggregate<br>
  function calculated outside the subquery, and a GROUP BY on<br>
  the outer SELECT could cause the server to crash.<br>
  (Bug#37348: http://bugs.mysql.com/37348)<br>
<br>
- The NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES SQL mode was ignored for LOAD DATA<br>
  INFILE and SELECT INTO ... OUTFILE. The setting is taken into<br>
  account now.<br>
  (Bug#37114: http://bugs.mysql.com/37114)<br>
<br>
- In some cases, references to views were confused with<br>
  references to anonymous tables and privilege checking was not<br>
  performed.<br>
  (Bug#36086: http://bugs.mysql.com/36086)<br>
<br>
- For crash reports on Windows, symbol names in stack traces<br>
  were not correctly resolved.<br>
  (Bug#35987: http://bugs.mysql.com/35987)<br>
<br>
- ALTER EVENT changed the PRESERVE attribute of an event even<br>
  when PRESERVE was not specified in the statement.<br>
  (Bug#35981: http://bugs.mysql.com/35981)<br>
<br>
- Hostname values in SQL statements were not being checked for<br>
  '@', which is illegal according to RFC952.<br>
  (Bug#35924: http://bugs.mysql.com/35924)<br>
<br>
- mysql_install_db failed on machines that had the hostname set<br>
  to localhost.<br>
  (Bug#35754: http://bugs.mysql.com/35754)<br>
<br>
- Dynamic plugins failed to load on i5/OS.<br>
  (Bug#35743: http://bugs.mysql.com/35743)<br>
<br>
- With the PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH SQL mode enabled, a ucs2 CHAR<br>
  column returned additional garbage after trailing space<br>
  characters.<br>
  (Bug#35720: http://bugs.mysql.com/35720)<br>
<br>
- With binary logging enabled, CREATE TABLE ... SELECT failed if<br>
  the source table was a log table.<br>
  (Bug#34306: http://bugs.mysql.com/34306)<br>
<br>
- A trigger for an InnoDB table activating multiple times could<br>
  lead to AUTO_INCREMENT gaps.<br>
  (Bug#31612: http://bugs.mysql.com/31612)<br>
<br>
- mysqldump could fail to dump views containing a large number<br>
  of columns.<br>
  (Bug#31434: http://bugs.mysql.com/31434)<br>
<br>
- The server could improperly type user-defined variables used<br>
  in the select list of a query.<br>
  (Bug#26020: http://bugs.mysql.com/26020)<br>
<br>
- For access to the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS table, the server<br>
  did not check the SHOW VIEW and SELECT provileges, leading to<br>
  inconsistency between output from that table and the SHOW<br>
  CREATE VIEW statement.<br>
  (Bug#22763: http://bugs.mysql.com/22763)<br>
<br>
- mysqld_safe would sometimes fail to remove the pid file for<br>
  the old mysql process after a crash. As a result, the server<br>
  would fail to start due to a false A mysqld process already<br>
  exists... error.<br>
  (Bug#11122: http://bugs.mysql.com/11122)<br>
