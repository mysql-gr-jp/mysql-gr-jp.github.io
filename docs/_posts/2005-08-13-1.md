<br>
- NDB: Improved handling of the configuration variables<br>
  NoOfPagesToDiskDuringRestartACC, NoOfPagesToDiskAfterRestartACC,<br>
  NoOfPagesToDiskDuringRestartTUP, and NoOfPagesToDiskAfterRestartTUP<br>
  should result in noticeably faster startup times for MySQL Cluster. (Bug #12149 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12149))<br>
