MySQL 5.1.14-beta がリリースされました。<br>
<br>
　http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/<br>
<br>
からダウンロードできます。<br>
<br>
5.1.13 はリリースされませんでしたので、5.1.12から約１ヶ月ぶりの バージョン 5.1 シリーズ のリリースになります。<br>
<br>
２バージョンぶんの変更が含まれているので（わずか１ヶ月ですが）、チェンジログが非常にもりだくさんになっています。<br>
<br>
------<br>
以下チェンジログ<br>
■機能の追加と変更(5.1.14)<br>
- Incompatible change: Previously, you could create a user-defined function (UDF) or stored function with the same name as a built-in function, but could not invoke the UDF. Now an error occurs if you try to create such a UDF. The server also now generates a warning if you create a stored function with the same name as a built-in function. It is not considered an error to create a stored function with the same name as a built-in function because you can invoke the function using db_name.func_name() syntax. However, the server now generates a warning in this case. (Bug#22619: http://bugs.mysql.com/22619) See Section 9.2.4, "Function Name Resolution," for the rules describing how the server interprets references to different kinds of functions.<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster (Replication): ndb_restore now creates the apply_status and schema tables if they do not already exist on the slave cluster. (Bug#14612: http://bugs.mysql.com/14612)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Backup messages are now printed to the Cluster log. (Bug#24544: http://bugs.mysql.com/24544)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: The error message Management server closed connection, when recorded in the MySQL error log, now includes a timestamp indicating when the error took place. (Bug#21519: http://bugs.mysql.com/21519)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster (Disk Data): The output of mysqldump now includes by default all tablespace and logfile group definitions used by any tables or databases that are dumped. (Bug#20839: http://bugs.mysql.com/20839) Note: The working of the --all-tablespaces or -Y option for mysqldump remains unaffected by this change.<br>
<br>
- Direct and indirect usage of stored routines, user-defined functions, and table references is now prohibited in CREATE EVENT and ALTER EVENT statements. (Bug#22830: http://bugs.mysql.com/22830) See Section 20.2.1, "CREATE EVENT Syntax," and Section 20.2.2, "ALTER EVENT Syntax," for more specific information.<br>
<br>
- DROP TRIGGER now supports an IF EXISTS clause. (Bug#23703: http://bugs.mysql.com/23703)<br>
<br>
<br>
■バグ修正(5.1.14)：<br>
- NDB Cluster (Replication): If errors occurred during purging of the binary logs, extraneous rows could remain left in the binlog_index table. (Bug#15021: http://bugs.mysql.com/15021)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster (Disk Data): ndb_restore could sometimes fail when attempting to restore Disk Data tables due to data node failure caused by accessing unitialized memory. (Bug#24331: http://bugs.mysql.com/24331)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster (Disk Data): Excessive fragmentation of Disk Data files (including log files and data files) could occur during the course of normal use. (Bug#24143: http://bugs.mysql.com/24143)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster (Disk Data): It was possible to execute a statement for creating a Disk Data table that referred to a nonexistent tablespace, in which case the table was an in-memory NDB table. Such a statement instead now fails with an appropriate error message. (Bug#23576: http://bugs.mysql.com/23576)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster (Disk Data): Under some circumstances, a DELETE from a Disk Data table could cause mysqld to crash. (Bug#23542: http://bugs.mysql.com/23542)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster (Cluster APIs): Using BIT values with any of the comparison methods of the NdbScanFilter class caused the cluster's data nodes to fail. (Bug#24503: http://bugs.mysql.com/24503)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: A value equal to or greater than the allowed maximum for LongMessageBuffer caused all data nodes to crash. (Bug#22547: http://bugs.mysql.com/22547)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: The failure of a data node failure during a schema operation could lead to additional node failures. (Bug#24752: http://bugs.mysql.com/24752)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: A committed read could be attempted before a data node had time to connect, causing a timeout error. (Bug#24717: http://bugs.mysql.com/24717)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: The simultaneous shutdown of mysqld and ndbd processes caused unnecessary locking. (Bug#24655: http://bugs.mysql.com/24655)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: The failure of the master node in a node group during the allocation of node IDs could cause ndb_mgmd to hang. (Bug#24543: http://bugs.mysql.com/24543)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: In certain rare cases, a data node could crash due to a typographical error in the MySQL Cluster source code. (Bug#24476: http://bugs.mysql.com/24476)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Creating a new tables containing a BLOB column when the server was short of memory could cause the server to crash. (Bug#24470: http://bugs.mysql.com/24470)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Any statement following the execution of CREATE TABLE ... LIKE ndb_table (where ndb_table was a table using the NDB storage engine), would cause the mysql client to hang. (Bug#24301: http://bugs.mysql.com/24301)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: When the management client command ALL RESTART -i was executed while one data node was not running, all data nodes in the cluster were shut down. (Bug#24105: http://bugs.mysql.com/24105)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: A query using an index scan followed by a delete operation, and then a rollback could cause one or more data nodes to crash. (Bug#24039: http://bugs.mysql.com/24039)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster (Cluster APIs): Some MGM API function calls could yield incorrect return values in certain cases where the cluster was operating under a very high load, or experienced timeouts in inter-node communications. (Bug#24011: http://bugs.mysql.com/24011)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: It was possible for the sum of the MaxNoOfTables, MaxNoOfOrderedIndexes, and MaxNoOfUniqueHashIndexes configuration parameters, plus the number of system tables to exceed the maximum value for a Uint32 number. In such a case, the cluster's data nodes failed to start, and no reason for this could easily be determined from the error messages provided. (Bug#22548: http://bugs.mysql.com/22548)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Given a table mytbl in a database mydb on a MySQL Server acting as an SQL node in a MySQL Cluster, then, following multiple ALTER TABLE mytbl ENGINE=engine statements --- first, to change the storage engine used for a table to NDB, and then again to change the table to use a non-NDB storage engine --- a DROP DATABASE mydb statement executed on any SQL node in the cluster would cause mydb to be dropped on all SQL nodes in the cluster, even if mydb contained non-NDB tables. (Bug#21495: http://bugs.mysql.com/21495)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: An incorrect error message was displayed in the event that the value of the MaxNoOfOrderedIndexes parameter was set too low. (Bug#20065: http://bugs.mysql.com/20065)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: An incorrect error message was displayed in the event that the value of the DataMemory parameter was insufficient for the amount of data to be stored by the cluster. (Bug#19808: http://bugs.mysql.com/19808)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: A unique constraint violation was not ignored by an UPDATE IGNORE statement when the constraint violation occurred on a non-primary key. (Bug#18487: http://bugs.mysql.com/18487, Bug#24303: http://bugs.mysql.com/24303)<br>
<br>
- Through the C API, the member strings in MYSQL_FIELD for a query that contains expressions may return incorrect results. (Bug#21635: http://bugs.mysql.com/21635)<br>
<br>
- mysql_affected_rows() could return values different from mysql_stmt_affected_rows() for the same sequence of statements. (Bug#23383: http://bugs.mysql.com/23383)<br>
<br>
- IN() and CHAR() can return NULL, but did not signal that to the query processor, causing incorrect results for IS NULL operations. (Bug#17047: http://bugs.mysql.com/17047)<br>
<br>
- Instance Manager option-parsing code caused memory-allocation errors. (Bug#22242: http://bugs.mysql.com/22242)<br>
<br>
- A trigger that invoked a stored function could cause a server crash when activated by different client connections. (Bug#23651: http://bugs.mysql.com/23651)<br>
<br>
- CONCURRENT did not work correctly for LOAD DATA INFILE. (Bug#20637: http://bugs.mysql.com/20637)<br>
<br>
- A stored procedure, executed from a connection using a binary character set, and which wrote multi-byte data, would write incorrectly escaped entries to the binary log. This caused syntax errors, and caused replication to fail. (Bug#23619: http://bugs.mysql.com/23619)<br>
<br>
- The server source code had multiple exportable definitions of the field_in_record_is_null() function. These are now all declared static. (Bug#24190: http://bugs.mysql.com/24190)<br>
<br>
- When reading from the standard input on Windows, mysqlbinlog opened the input in text mode rather than binary mode and consequently misinterpreted some characters such as Control-Z. (Bug#23735: http://bugs.mysql.com/23735)<br>
<br>
- Inserting a default or invalid value into a spatial column could fail with Unknown error rather than a more appropriate error. (Bug#21790: http://bugs.mysql.com/21790)<br>
<br>
- The server could send incorrect column count information to the client for queries that produce a larger number of columns than can fit in a two-byte number. (Bug#19216: http://bugs.mysql.com/19216)<br>
<br>
- Evaluation of subqueries that require the filesort algorithm were allocating and freeing the sort_buffer_size buffer many times, resulting in slow performance. Now the buffer is allocated once and reused. (Bug#21727: http://bugs.mysql.com/21727)<br>
<br>
- SQL statements close to the size of max_allowed_packet could produce binary log events larger than max_allowed_packet that could not be read by slave servers. (Bug#19402: http://bugs.mysql.com/19402)<br>
<br>
- View columns were always handled as having implicit derivation, leading to illegal mix of collation errors for some views in UNION operations. Now view column column derivation comes from the original expression given in the view definition. (Bug#21505: http://bugs.mysql.com/21505)<br>
<br>
- If elements in a non-top-level IN subquery were accessed by an index and the subquery result set included a NULL value, the quantified predicate that contained the subquery was evaluated to NULL when it should return a non-NULL value. (Bug#23478: http://bugs.mysql.com/23478)<br>
<br>
- Calculation of COUNT(DISTINCT), AVG(DISTINCT), or SUM(DISTINCT) when they are referenced more than once in a single query with GROUP BY could cause a server crash. (Bug#23184: http://bugs.mysql.com/23184)<br>
<br>
- For a cast of a DATETIME value containing microseconds to DECIMAL, the microseconds part was truncated without generating a warning. Now the microseconds part is preserved. (Bug#19491: http://bugs.mysql.com/19491)<br>
<br>
- Metadata for columns calculated from scalar subqueries was limited to integer, double, or string, even if the actual type of the column was different. (Bug#11032: http://bugs.mysql.com/11032)<br>
<br>
- The result for CAST() when casting a value to UNSIGNED was limited to the maximum signed BIGINT value, not the maximum unsigned value. (Bug#8663: http://bugs.mysql.com/8663)<br>
<br>
- Some unnecessary Valgrind warnings were removed from the server. (Bug#24488: http://bugs.mysql.com/24488, Bug#24533: http://bugs.mysql.com/24533).<br>
<br>
- Using EXPLAIN caused a server crash for queries that selected from INFORMATION_SCHEMA in a subquery in the FROM clause. (Bug#22413: http://bugs.mysql.com/22413)<br>
<br>
- Invalidating the query cache caused a server crash for INSERT INTO ... SELECT statements that selected from a view. (Bug#20045: http://bugs.mysql.com/20045)<br>
<br>
- With row-based binary logging, replicated multiple-statement transaction deadlocks did not return the correct error code, causing the slave SQL thread to stop rather than roll back and re-execute. (Bug#23831: http://bugs.mysql.com/23831)<br>
<br>
- With row-based binary logging, for CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS LIKE temporary_table statements, the IF NOT EXISTS clause was not logged. (Bug#22762: http://bugs.mysql.com/22762)<br>
<br>
- With row-based binary logging, CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS SELECT statements were not logged properly. (Bug#22027: http://bugs.mysql.com/22027)<br>
<br>
- On slave servers, transactions that exceeded the lock wait timeout failed to roll back properly. (Bug#20697: http://bugs.mysql.com/20697)<br>
<br>
- Changes to character set variables prior to an action on a replication-ignored table were forgotten by slave servers. (Bug#22877: http://bugs.mysql.com/22877)<br>
<br>
- With lower_case_table_names set to 1, SHOW CREATE TABLE printed incorrect output for table names containing Turkish I (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE). (Bug#20404: http://bugs.mysql.com/20404)<br>
<br>
- When applying the group_concat_max_len limit, GROUP_CONCAT() could truncate multi-byte characters in the middle. (Bug#23451: http://bugs.mysql.com/23451)<br>
<br>
- For view renaming, the table name to filename encoding was not performed. (Bug#21370: http://bugs.mysql.com/21370)<br>
<br>
- For some problems relating to character set conversion or incorrect string values for INSERT or UPDATE, the server was reporting truncation or length errors instead. (Bug#18908: http://bugs.mysql.com/18908)<br>
<br>
- The XPath operators < and >, as implemented in the ExtractValue() function, operated in reverse. (Bug#22823: http://bugs.mysql.com/22823)<br>
