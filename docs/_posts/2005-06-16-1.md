--------------<br>
MySQL 5.0.7 での変更点<br>
■機能の追加と変更： <br>
<br>
- Placeholders now can be used for LIMIT in prepared statements. (Bug #7306 (http://bugs.mysql.com/7306)) <br>
<br>
- SHOW BINARY LOGS now displays a File_size column that indicates the size of each file. <br>
<br>
- The --delayed-insert option for mysqldump has been disabled to avoid causing problems with storage engines that do not support INSERT DELAYED. (Bug #7815 (http://bugs.mysql.com/7815)) <br>
<br>
- Improved the optimizer to be able to use indexes for expressions of the form indexed_col NOT IN (val1, val2, ...) and indexed_col NOT BETWEEN val1 AND val2.. (Bug #10561 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10561)) <br>
<br>
- Removed mysqlshutdown.exe and mysqlwatch.exe from the Windows ``No Installer'' distribution (they had already been removed from the ``With Installer'' distribution before). Removed those programs from the source distribution. <br>
<br>
- Removed WinMySQLAdmin from the source distribution and from the ``No Installer'' Windows distribution (it had already been removed from the ``With Installer'' distribution before).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
■バグ修正： <br>
<br>
- Using ORDER BY to sort the results of an IF() that contained a FROM_UNIXTIME() expression returned incorrect results due to integer overflow. (Bug #9669 (http://bugs.mysql.com/9669)) <br>
<br>
- Fixed a server crash resulting from accessing InnoDB tables within stored functions. This is handled by prohibiting statements that do an explicit or explicit commit or rollback within stored functions or triggers. (Bug #10015 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10015)) <br>
<br>
- Fixed a server crash resulting from the second invocation of a stored procedure that selected from a view defined as a join that used ON in the join conditions. (Bug #6866 (http://bugs.mysql.com/6866)) <br>
<br>
- Using ALTER TABLE for a table that had a trigger caused a crash when executing a statement that activated the trigger, and also a crash later with USE db_name for the database containing the table. (Bug #5894 (http://bugs.mysql.com/5894)) <br>
<br>
- Fixed a server crash resulting from an attempt to allocate too much memory when GROUP BY blob_col and COUNT(DISTINCT) were used. (Bug #11088 (http://bugs.mysql.com/11088)) <br>
<br>
- Fixed a portability problem for compiling on Windows with Visual Studio 6. (Bug #11153 (http://bugs.mysql.com/11153)) <br>
<br>
- The incorrect sequence of statements HANDLER tbl_name READ index_name NEXT without a preceding HANDLER tbl_name READ index_name = (value_list) for an InnoDB table resulted in a server crash rather than an error. (Bug #5373 (http://bugs.mysql.com/5373)) <br>
<br>
- On Windows, with lower_case_table_names set to 2, using ALTER TABLE to alter a MEMORY or InnoDB table that had a mixed-case name also improperly changed the name to lowercase. (Bug #9660 (http://bugs.mysql.com/9660)) <br>
<br>
- The server timed out SSL connections too quickly on Windows. (Bug #8572 (http://bugs.mysql.com/8572)) <br>
<br>
- Executing LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE for a table while other threads where selecting from the table caused a deadlock. (Bug #10602 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10602)) <br>
<br>
- Fixed a server crash resulting from CREATE TABLE ... SELECT that selected from a table being altered by ALTER TABLE. (Bug #10224 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10224)) <br>
<br>
- The FEDERATED storage engine properly handled outer joins, but not inner joins. (Bug #10848 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10848)) <br>
<br>
- Consistently report INFORMATION_SCHEMA table names in uppercase in SHOW TABLE STATUS output. (Bug #10059 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10059)) <br>
<br>
- Fixed a failure of WITH ROLLUP to sum values properly. (Bug #10982 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10982)) <br>
<br>
- Fixed server crash on Windows caused by USE db_name where db_name is a Windows device name such as LPT1 or PRN. (CAN-2005-0799 (http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0799)) (Bug #9148 (http://bugs.mysql.com/9148)) <br>
<br>
- Triggers were not being activated for multiple-table UPDATE or DELETE statements. (Bug #5860 (http://bugs.mysql.com/5860)) <br>
<br>
- INSERT BEFORE triggers were not being activated for INSERT ... SELECT statements. (Bug #6812 (http://bugs.mysql.com/6812)) <br>
<br>
- INSERT BEFORE triggers were not being activated for implicit inserts (LOAD DATA). (Bug #8755 (http://bugs.mysql.com/8755)) <br>
<br>
- If a stored function contained a FLUSH statement, the function crashed when invoked. FLUSH now is disallowed within stored functions. (Bug #8409 (http://bugs.mysql.com/8409)) <br>
<br>
- Fixed a server crash resulting from invalid string pointer when inserting into the mysql.host table. (Bug #10181 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10181)) <br>
<br>
- Multiple-table DELETE did always delete on the fly from the first table that was to be deleted from. In some cases, when using many tables and it was necessary to access the same row twice in the first table, we could miss some rows-to-be-deleted from other tables. This is now fixed. <br>
<br>
- The mysql_next_result() function could hang if you were executing many statements in a mysql_real_query() call and one of those statements raised an error. (Bug #9992 (http://bugs.mysql.com/9992)) <br>
<br>
- The combination of COUNT(), DISTINCT, and CONCAT() sometimes triggered a memory deallocation bug on Windows resulting in a server crash. (Bug #9593 (http://bugs.mysql.com/9593)) <br>
<br>
- InnoDB: Do very fast shutdown only if innodb_fast_shutdown=2, but wait for threads to exit and release allocated memory if innodb_fast_shutdown=1. Starting with MySQL/InnoDB 5.0.5, InnoDB would do brutal shutdown also when innodb_fast_shutdown=1. (Bug #9673 (http://bugs.mysql.com/9673)) <br>
<br>
- InnoDB: Fixed InnoDB: Error: stored_select_lock_type is 0 inside ::start_stmt()! in a stored procedure call if innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog was set in my.cnf. (Bug #10746 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10746)) <br>
<br>
- Fixed a server crash for INSERT or UPDATE when the WHERE clause contained a correlated subquery that referred to a column of the table being modified. (Bug #6384 (http://bugs.mysql.com/6384)) <br>
<br>
- Fixed a problem causing an incorrect result for columns that include an aggregate function as part of an expression when WITH ROLLUP is added to GROUP BY. (Bug #7914 (http://bugs.mysql.com/7914)) <br>
<br>
- Fixed a problem with returning an incorrect result from a view that selected a COALESCE() expression from the result of an outer join. (Bug #9938 (http://bugs.mysql.com/9938)) <br>
<br>
- MySQL was adding a DEFAULT clause to ENUM columns that included no explicit DEFAULT and were defined as NOT NULL. (This is supposed to happen only for columns that are NULL.) (Bug #6267 (http://bugs.mysql.com/6267)) <br>
<br>
- Corrected inappropriate error messages that were displayed when attempting to set the read-only warning_count and error_count system variables. (Bug #10339 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10339)) <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
- Condition pushdown and left join, wrong result (Bug #9246) <br>
