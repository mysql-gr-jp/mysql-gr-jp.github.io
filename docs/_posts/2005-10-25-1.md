MySQL バージョン 5.0.15 がリリースされました　（バージョン 5.0.14 はリリースされませんでした）。<br>
<br>
MySQL 5.0 系列はこれまで、 alpha → beta → rc と開発が進められてきましたが、今回の 5.0.15 で、これらの記号がとれました。<br>
つまり 「MySQL 5.0 系列の最初のリリース」 になります。<br>
<br>
もちろん、各種業務でみなさんが本格的に使用されるのはこれからでしょうから、様々なノウハウの積み上げもこれからなされていくことになります。<br>
実際に使用してみての、情報をぜひ [url=http://www.mysql.gr.jp/ml.html]メーリングリスト[/url] にお寄せください。　その情報は 日本の MySQLユーザ共通の財産となることでしょう。<br>

以下チェンジログ：<br>
<br>
■機能の追加と変更： <br>
<br>
- Warning: Incompatible change. The CHAR() function now returns a binary string rather than a string in the connection character set. An optional USING charset clause may be used to produce a result in a specific character set instead. Also, arguments larger than 256 produce multiple characters. They are no longer interpreted modulo 256 to produce a single character each. These changes may cause some incompatibilities, as noted in Section 2.10.2, "Upgrading from Version 4.1 to 5.0." <br>
<br>
- NDBCluster: The perror utility included with the MySQL-Server RPM now provides support for the --ndb option, and so can be used to obtain error message text for MySQL Cluster error codes. (Bug #13740 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13740)) <br>
<br>
- When executing single-table UPDATE or DELETE queries containing an ORDER BY ... LIMIT N clause, but not having any WHERE clause, MySQL can now take advantage of an index to read the first N rows in the ordering specified in the query. If an index is used, only the first N records will be read, as opposed to scanning the entire table. (Bug #12915 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12915)) <br>
<br>
- The MySQL-server RPM now explicitly assigns the mysql system user to the mysql user group during the postinstallation process. This corrects an issue with upgrading the server on some Linux distributions whereby a previously existing mysql user was not changed to the mysql group, resulting in wrong groups for files created following the installation. (Bug #12823 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12823)) <br>
<br>
- Added the --tz-utc option to mysqldump. This option adds SET TIME_ZONE='+00:00' to the dump file so that TIMESTAMP columns can be dumped and reloaded between servers in different time zones and protected from changes due to daylight saving time. (Bug #13052 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13052)) <br>
<br>
- When declaring a local variable (or parameter) named password or name, and setting it with SET, e.g. SET password = '', the new error message: ERROR 42000: Variable 'nnn' must be quoted with `...`, or renamed is returned (where 'nnn' is 'password' or 'names'). This means there is a syntax conflict with special sentences like SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD(...) (for setting a user's password) and set names default (for setting charset and collation). This must be resolved either by quoting the variable name: SET `password` = ..., which will set the local variable `password`, or by renaming the variable to something else (if setting the user's password is the desired effect). <br>
<br>
- The following statements now cause an implicit COMMIT:<br>
   + CREATE VIEW<br>
   + ALTER VIEW<br>
   + DROP VIEW<br>
   + CREATE TRIGGER<br>
   + DROP TRIGGER<br>
   + CREATE USER <br>
   + RENAME USER <br>
   + DROP USER <br>
<br>
- NDBCluster: A number of new or improved error messages have been implemented in this release in order to provide better and more accurate diagnostic information regarding cluster configuration issues and problems. (Bug #11739 (http://bugs.mysql.com/11739), Bug #11749 (http://bugs.mysql.com/11749), Bug #12044 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12044), Bug #12786 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12786), Bug #13197 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13197)) <br>
<br>
- NDBCluster: A new "smart" node allocation algorithm means that it is no longer necessary to use sequential IDs for cluster nodes, and that nodes not explicitly assigned IDs should now have IDs allocated automatically in most cases. In practical terms, this means that it is now possible to assign a set of node IDs such as 1, 2, 4, 5 without an error being generated due to the missing 3. (Bug #13009 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13009)) <br>
<br>
<br>
■バグ修正： <br>
<br>
- Character set conversion was not being done for FIND_IN_SET(). (Bug #13751 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13751)) <br>
<br>
- CAST(1E+300 TO SIGNED INT) produced an incorrect result on little-endian machines. (Bug #13344 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13344)) <br>
<br>
- Corrected a memory-copying problem for big5 values when using icc compiler on Linux IA-64 systems. (Bug #10836 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10836)) <br>
<br>
- On BSD systems, the system crypt() call could return an error for some salt values. The error was not handled, resulting in a server crash. (Bug #13619 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13619)) <br>
<br>
- Character set file parsing during mysql_real_connect() read past the end of a memory buffer. (Bug #6413 (http://bugs.mysql.com/6413)) <br>
<br>
- InnoDB: Queries that were executed using an index_merge union or intersection could produce incorrect results if the underlying table used the InnoDB storage engine and had a primary key containing VARCHAR members. (Bug #13484 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13484)) <br>
<br>
- CREATE DEFINER=... VIEW ... caused the server to crash when run with --skip-grant-tables. (Bug #) <br>
<br>
- The --interactive-timeout and --slave-net-timeout options for mysqld were not being obeyed on Mac OS X and other BSD-based platforms. (Bug #8731 (http://bugs.mysql.com/8731)) <br>
<br>
- Queries of the form (SELECT ...) ORDER BY ... were being treated as a UNION. This improperly resulted in only distinct values being returned (because UNION by default eliminates duplicate results). Also, references to column aliases in ORDER BY clauses following parenthesized SELECT statements were not resolved properly. (Bug #7672 (http://bugs.mysql.com/7672)) <br>
<br>
- If special characters such as '_' , '%', or the escape character were included within the prefix of a column index, LIKE pattern matching on the indexed column did not return the correct result. (Bug #13046 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13046),Bug#13919(http://bugs.mysql.com/13919)) <br>
<br>
- An UPDATE query using a join would be executed incorrectly on a replication slave. (Bug #12618 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12618)) <br>
<br>
- Server crashed during a SELECT statement, writing a message like this to the error log: InnoDB: Error: MySQL is trying to perform a SELECT InnoDB: but it has not locked any tables in ::external_lock()! (Bug #12736 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12736)) <br>
<br>
- NDBCluster: ndb_mgmd would allow a node to be stopped or restarted while another node was still starting up, which could crash the cluster. It should now not be possible to issue a node stop or restart while a different node is still restarting, and the cluster management client issues an error if an attempt is made to do so. (Bug #13461 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13461)) <br>
<br>
- NDBCluster: Placing multiple [TCP DEFAULT] sections in the cluster config.ini file crashed ndb_mgmd. (The ndb_mgmd process now exits gracefully with an appropriate error message instead.) (Bug #13611 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13611)) <br>
<br>
- NDBCluster: Trying to run ndbd as system root when connecting to a mysqld process running as the mysql system user via SHM caused the ndbd process to crash. (ndbd should now exit gracefully with an appropriate error message instead.) (Bug #9249 (http://bugs.mysql.com/9249)) <br>
<br>
- Server may over-allocate memory when performing a FULLTEXT search for stopwords only. (Bug #13582 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13582)) <br>
<br>
- Queries that use indexes in normal SELECT statements may cause range scans in VIEWs. (Bug #13327 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13327)) <br>
<br>
- When calling a stored procedure with the syntax CALL schema.procedurename and no default schema selected, ERROR 1046 was displayed after the procedure returned. (Bug #13616 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13616)) <br>
<br>
- With --log-slave-updates Exec_master_log_pos of SQL thread lagged IO (Bug #13023 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13023)) <br>
<br>
- SHOW CREATE TABLE did not display any FOREIGN KEY clauses if a temporary file could not be created. Now SHOW CREATE TABLE displays an error message in an SQL comment if this occurs. (Bug #13002 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13002)) <br>
<br>
- A column in the ON condition of a join that referenced a table in a nested join could not be resolved if the nested join was a right join. (Bug #13597 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13597)) <br>
<br>
- A qualified reference to a view column in the HAVING clause could not be resolved. (Bug #13410 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13410)) <br>
<br>
- comp_err did not detect when multiple error messages for a language were given for an error symbol. (Bug #13071 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13071)) <br>
<br>
- For XA transaction IDs (gtrid.bqual.formatID), uniqueness is supposed to be assessed based on gtrid and bqual. MySQL was also including formatID in the uniqueness check. (Bug #13143 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13143)) <br>
<br>
- Local (non-XA) and XA transactions are supposed to be mutually exclusive within a given client connection, but this prohibition was not always enforced. (Bug #12935 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12935)) <br>
<br>
- mysqlcheck --all-databases --analyze --optimize failed because it also tried to analyze and optimize the INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables which it can't. (Bug #13783 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13783)) <br>
<br>
- SELECT * INTO OUTFILE ... FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.schemata failed with an Access denied error. (Bug #13202 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13202)) <br>
<br>
- A table or view named &Ccedil; (C-cedilla) couldn't be dropped. (Bug #13145 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13145)) <br>
<br>
- Tests containing SHOW TABLE STATUS or INFORMATION_SCHEMA failed on opnsrv6c. (Bug #14064, Bug #14065 (http://bugs.mysql.com/14065)) <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
■追加情報: <br>
<br>
- The build type "classic" (not published under GPL, requires a commercial license) is discontinued. <br>
<br>
- Platform identification in the package names has been simplified: The vendor names, true ("apple", "hp", "ibm", "sgi", "sun") as well as pseudo ("pc", "unknown"), have been dropped, "linux-gnu" is now called simply "linux", "solaris2.{8,9,10}" is simplified to "solaris{8,9,10}", the OS X releases are now identified as "osx10.{3,4}" and not as "darwin{7,8}". <br>
<br>
- Linux binaries for the IA64 CPU are now compiled using Intel's "ICC" compiler, version 9 (the download page may still show the previous version number, 8.1). <br>
<br>
- For the "x86" (32 bit) and "x86_64" (AMD, 64 bit) CPUs, the GNU "gcc" compiler is used. <br>
<br>
- No builds of version 5 are done for the "Tru64" operating system (formerly Digital "OSF/1", then Compaq, now HP), for Linux using the Alpha CPU, or for AIX version 4.3. <br>
<br>
- For AIX 5.2, both 32 and 64 bit, the cluster engine ("NDB") is not built, so the (GPL) "max" build does not contain that table handler, and there is no (commercial license) build type "cluster" for AIX 5.2. <br>
