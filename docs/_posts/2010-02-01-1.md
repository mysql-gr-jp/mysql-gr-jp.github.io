-----------------------<br>
以下チェンジログ(5.1.43)：<br>
<br>
<br>
■InnoDB Plugin 関係：<br>
     * This release includes InnoDB Plugin 1.0.6. This version is<br>
       considered of Release Candidate (RC) quality.<br>
<br>
<br>
■機能の追加と変更：<br>
     * Partitioning: The UNIX_TIMESTAMP() function is now supported<br>
       in partitioning expressions using TIMESTAMP columns. For<br>
       example, it now possible to create a partitioned table such as<br>
       this one:<br>
CREATE TABLE t (c TIMESTAMP)<br>
PARTITION BY RANGE ( UNIX_TIMESTAMP(c) ) (<br>
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (631148400),<br>
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (946681200),<br>
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)<br>
);<br>
       All other expressions involving TIMESTAMP values are now<br>
       rejected with an error when attempting to create a new<br>
       partitioned table or to alter an existing partitioned table.<br>
       When accessing an existing partitioned table having a<br>
       timezone-dependent partitioning function (where the table was<br>
       using a previous version of MySQL), a warning rather than an<br>
       error is issued. In such cases, you should fix the table. One<br>
       way of doing this is to alter the table's partitioning<br>
       expression so that it uses UNIX_TIMESTAMP().<br>
       (Bug#42849: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=42849)<br>
<br>
<br>
■バグ修正：<br>
     * Security Fix: For servers built with yaSSL, a preauthorization<br>
       buffer overflow could cause memory corruption or a server<br>
       crash. We thank Evgeny Legerov from Intevydis for providing us<br>
       with a proof-of-concept script that allowed us to reproduce<br>
       this bug. (Bug#50227: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50227,<br>
       CVE-2009-4484<br>
       (http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-4484))<br>
<br>
     * Important Change: Replication: The RAND() function is now<br>
       marked as unsafe for statement-based replication. Using this<br>
       function now generates a warning when binlog_format=STATEMENT<br>
       and causes the the format to switch to row-based logging when<br>
       binlog_format=MIXED.<br>
       This change is being introduced because, when RAND() was<br>
       logged in statement mode, the seed was also written to the<br>
       binary log, so the replication slave generated the same<br>
       sequence of random numbers as was generated on the master.<br>
       While this could make replication work in some cases, the<br>
       order of affected rows was still not guaranteed when this<br>
       function was used in statements that could update multiple<br>
       rows, such as UPDATE or INSERT ... SELECT; if the master and<br>
       the slave retrieved rows in different order, they began to<br>
       diverge. (Bug#49222: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49222)<br>
<br>
     * Partitioning: When used on partitioned tables, the<br>
       records_in_range handler call checked all partitions, rather<br>
       than the unpruned partitions only.<br>
       (Bug#48846: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48846)<br>
       See also Bug#37252: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=37252,<br>
       Bug#47261: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47261.<br>
<br>
     * Partitioning: A query that searched on a ucs2 column failed if<br>
       the table was partitioned.<br>
       (Bug#48737: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48737)<br>
<br>
     * Replication: A LOAD DATA INFILE statement that loaded data<br>
       into a table having a column name that must be escaped (such<br>
       as `key` INT), caused replication to fail when logging in<br>
       mixed or statement mode. In such cases, the master wrote the<br>
       LOAD DATA event to the binary log without escaping the field<br>
       names. (Bug#49473: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49473)<br>
       See also Bug#47927: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47927.<br>
<br>
     * Replication: Spatial data types cause row-based replication to<br>
       crash. (Bug#48776: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48776)<br>
<br>
     * Replication: A flaw in the implementation of the purging of<br>
       binary logs could result in orphaned files being left behind<br>
       in the following circumstances:<br>
<br>
          + If the server failed or was killed while purging binary<br>
            logs.<br>
            If the server failed or was killed after creating of a<br>
            new binary log when the new log file was opened for the<br>
            first time.<br>
       In addition, if the slave was not connected during the purge<br>
       operation, it was possible for a log file that was in use to<br>
       be removed; this could lead data loss and possible<br>
       inconsistencies between the master and slave.<br>
       (Bug#45292: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=45292)<br>
<br>
     * Replication: When using the STATEMENT or MIXED logging format,<br>
       the statements LOAD DATA CONCURRENT LOCAL INFILE and LOAD DATA<br>
       CONCURRENT INFILE were logged as LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE and<br>
       LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE, respectively (in other words, the<br>
       CONCURRENT keyword was omitted). As a result, when using<br>
       replication with either of these logging modes, queries on the<br>
       slaves were blocked by the replication SQL thread while trying<br>
       to execute the affected statements.<br>
       (Bug#34628: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=34628)<br>
<br>
     * Replication: Manually removing entries from the binary log<br>
       index file on a replication master could cause the server to<br>
       repeatedly send the same binary log file to slaves.<br>
       (Bug#28421: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=28421)<br>
<br>
     * Cluster Replication: When expire_logs_days was set, the thread<br>
       performing the purge of the log files could deadlock, causing<br>
       all binary log operations to stop.<br>
       (Bug#49536: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49536)<br>
<br>
     * Within a stored routine, selecting the result of CONCAT_WS()<br>
       with a routine parameter argument into a user variable could<br>
       return incorrect results.<br>
       (Bug#50096: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50096)<br>
<br>
     * The IBMDB2I storage engine was missing from the i5os 64-bit<br>
       distribution of MySQL 5.1.42. It is now included again.<br>
       (Bug#50059: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50059)<br>
<br>
     * EXPLAIN EXTENDED UNION ... ORDER BY caused a crash when the<br>
       ORDER BY referred to a nonconstant or full-text function or a<br>
       subquery. (Bug#49734: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49734)<br>
<br>
     * The push_warning_printf() function was being called with an<br>
       invalid error level MYSQL_ERROR::WARN_LEVEL_ERROR, causing an<br>
       assertion failure. To fix the problem,<br>
       MYSQL_ERROR::WARN_LEVEL_ERROR has been replaced by<br>
       MYSQL_ERROR::WARN_LEVEL_WARN.<br>
       (Bug#49638: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49638)<br>
<br>
     * Some prepared statements could raise an assertion when<br>
       re-executed.<br>
       (Bug#49570: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49570)<br>
<br>
     * A Valgrind error in make_cond_for_table_from_pred() was<br>
       corrected. Thanks to Sergey Petrunya for the patch to fix this<br>
       bug. (Bug#49506: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49506)<br>
<br>
     * When compiling on Windows, an error in the CMake definitions<br>
       for InnoDB would cause the engine to be built incorrectly.<br>
       (Bug#49502: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49502)<br>
<br>
     * Valgrind warnings for CHECKSUM TABLE were corrected.<br>
       (Bug#49465: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49465)<br>
<br>
     * Specifying an index algorithm (such as BTREE) for SPATIAL or<br>
       FULLTEXT indexes caused a server crash. These index types do<br>
       not support algorithm specification, and it is now disallowed<br>
       to do so. (Bug#49250: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49250)<br>
<br>
     * The optimizer sometimes incorrectly handled conditions of the<br>
       form WHERE col_name='const1' AND col_name='const2'.<br>
       (Bug#49199: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49199)<br>
<br>
     * Execution of DECODE() and ENCODE() could be inefficient<br>
       because multiple executions within a single statement<br>
       reinitialized the random generator multiple times even with<br>
       constant parameters.<br>
       (Bug#49141: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49141)<br>
<br>
     * MySQL 5.1 does not support 2-byte collation numbers, but did<br>
       not check the number and crashed for out-of-range values.<br>
       (Bug#49134: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49134)<br>
<br>
     * With binary logging enabled, REVOKE ... ON<br>
       {PROCEDURE|FUNCTION} FROM ... could cause a crash.<br>
       (Bug#49119: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49119)<br>
<br>
     * The LIKE operator did not work correctly when using an index<br>
       for a ucs2 column.<br>
       (Bug#49028: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49028)<br>
<br>
     * check_key_in_view() was missing a DBUG_RETURN in one code<br>
       branch, causing a crash in debug builds.<br>
       (Bug#48995: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48995)<br>
<br>
     * Several strmake() calls had an incorrect length argument (too<br>
       large by one).<br>
       (Bug#48983: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48983)<br>
<br>
     * On Fedora 12, strmov() did not guarantee correct operation for<br>
       overlapping source and destination buffer. Calls were fixed to<br>
       use an overlap-safe version instead.<br>
       (Bug#48866: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48866)<br>
<br>
     * Incomplete reset of internal TABLE structures could cause a<br>
       crash with eq_ref table access in subqueries.<br>
       (Bug#48709: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48709)<br>
<br>
     * Re-execution of a prepared statement could cause a server<br>
       crash. (Bug#48508: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48508)<br>
<br>
     * The error message for ER_UPDATE_INFO was subject to buffer<br>
       overflow or truncation.<br>
       (Bug#48500: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48500)<br>
<br>
     * SHOW BINLOG EVENTS could fail with a error: Wrong offset or<br>
       I/O error. (Bug#48357: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48357)<br>
<br>
     * Valgrind warnings related to binary logging of LOAD DATA<br>
       INFILE statements were corrected.<br>
       (Bug#48340: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48340)<br>
<br>
     * An aliasing violation in the C API could lead to a crash.<br>
       (Bug#48284: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48284)<br>
<br>
     * The InnoDB Monitor could fail to print diagnostic information<br>
       after a long lock wait.<br>
       (Bug#47814: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47814)<br>
<br>
     * Queries containing GROUP BY ... WITH ROLLUP that did not use<br>
       indexes could return incorrect results.<br>
       (Bug#47650: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47650)<br>
<br>
     * If an invocation of a stored procedure failed in the<br>
       table-open stage, subsequent invocations that did not fail in<br>
       that stage could cause a crash.<br>
       (Bug#47649: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47649)<br>
<br>
     * On Solaris, no stack trace was printed to the error log after<br>
       a crash. (Bug#47391: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47391)<br>
<br>
     * The first execution of STOP SLAVE UNTIL stopped too early.<br>
       (Bug#47210: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47210)<br>
<br>
     * When the mysql client was invoked with the --vertical option,<br>
       it ignored the --skip-column-names option.<br>
       (Bug#47147: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47147)<br>
<br>
     * It was possible for init_available_charsets() not to<br>
       initialize correctly.<br>
       (Bug#45058: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=45058)<br>
<br>
     * Comparison with NULL values sometimes did not produce a<br>
       correct result.<br>
       (Bug#42760: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=42760)<br>
<br>
     * Crash recovery did not work for InnoDB temporary tables.<br>
       (Bug#41609: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=41609)<br>
<br>
     * The mysql_upgrade command would create three additional fields<br>
       to the mysql.proc table (character_set_client,<br>
       collation_connection, and db_collation), but did not populate<br>
       the fields with correct values. This would lead to error<br>
       messages reported during stored procedure execution.<br>
       (Bug#41569: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=41569)<br>
<br>
     * When compressed MyISAM files were opened, they were always<br>
       memory mapped, sometimes causing memory-swapping problems. To<br>
       deal with this, a new system variable, myisam_mmap_size, was<br>
       added to limit the amount of memory used for memory mapping of<br>
       MyISAM files.<br>
       (Bug#37408: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=37408)<br>
<br>
     * A race condition on the privilege hash tables allowed one<br>
       thread to try to delete elements that had already been deleted<br>
       by another thread. A consequence was that SET PASSWORD or<br>
       FLUSH PRIVILEGES could cause a crash.<br>
       (Bug#35589: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=35589,<br>
       Bug#35591: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=35591)<br>
<br>
     * ALTER TABLE with both DROP COLUMN and ADD COLUMN clauses could<br>
       crash or lock up the server.<br>
       (Bug#31145: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=31145)<br>
