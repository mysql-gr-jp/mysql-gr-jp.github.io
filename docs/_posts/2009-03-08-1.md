以下チェンジログ(5.1.32)：<br>
<br>
<br>
■機能の追加と変更(5.1.32)：<br>
* Important Change: Replication: RESET MASTER and RESET SLAVE<br>
  now reset the values shown for Last_IO_Error, Last_IO_Errno,<br>
  Last_SQL_Error, and Last_SQL_Errno in the output of SHOW SLAVE<br>
  STATUS. (Bug#34654: http://bugs.mysql.com/34654)<br>
<br>
* Incompatible Change: The fix for<br>
  Bug#33699: http://bugs.mysql.com/33699 introduced a change to<br>
  the UPDATE statement such that assigning NULL to a NOT NULL<br>
  column caused an error even when strict SQL mode was not<br>
  enabled. The original behavior before was that such<br>
  assignments caused an error only in strict SQL mode, and<br>
  otherwise set the column to the the implicit default value for<br>
  the column data type and generated a warning. (For information<br>
  about implicit default values, see Section 10.1.4, "Data Type<br>
  Default Values.")<br>
  The change caused compatibility problems for applications that<br>
  relied on the original behavior. It also caused replication<br>
  problems between servers that had the original behavior and<br>
  those that did not, for applications that assigned NULL to NOT<br>
  NULL columns in UPDATE statements without strict SQL mode<br>
  enabled. This change has been reverted so that UPDATE again<br>
  had the original behavior. Problems can still occur if you<br>
  replicate between servers that have the modified UPDATE<br>
  behavior and those that do not.<br>
  (Bug#39265: http://bugs.mysql.com/39265)<br>
<br>
* The libedit library was upgraded to version 2.11.<br>
  (Bug#42433: http://bugs.mysql.com/42433)<br>
<br>
<br>
■バグ修正(5.1.32):<br>
* Security Fix: Using an XPath expression employing a scalar<br>
  expression as a FilterExpr<br>
  (http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath#NT-FilterExpr) with ExtractValue()<br>
  or UpdateXML() caused the server to crash. Such expressions<br>
  now cause an error instead.<br>
  (Bug#42495: http://bugs.mysql.com/42495)<br>
<br>
* Replication: START SLAVE UNTIL did not work correctly with<br>
  --replicate-same-server-id enabled; when started with this<br>
  option, the slave did not perform events recorded in the relay<br>
  log and that originated from a different master.<br>
  Log rotation events are automatically generated and written<br>
  when rotating the binary log or relay log. Such events for<br>
  relay logs are usually ignored by the slave SQL thread because<br>
  they have the same server ID as that of the slave. However,<br>
  when --replicate-same-server-id was enabled, the rotation<br>
  event for the relay log was treated as if it originated on the<br>
  master, because the log's name and position were incorrectly<br>
  updated. This caused the MASTER_POS_WAIT() function always to<br>
  return NULL and thus to fail.<br>
  (Bug#38734: http://bugs.mysql.com/38734,<br>
   Bug#38934: http://bugs.mysql.com/38934)<br>
<br>
* Replication: TRUNCATE statements failed to replicate when<br>
  statement-based binary logging mode was not available. The<br>
  issue was observed when using InnoDB with the transaction<br>
  isolation level set to READ UNCOMMITTED (thus forcing InnoDB<br>
  not to allow statement-based logging). However, the same<br>
  behavior could be reproduced using any transactional storage<br>
  engine supporting only row-based logging, regardless of the<br>
  isolation level. This was due to two separate problems:<br>
<br>
    1. An error was printed by InnoDB for TRUNCATE when using<br>
       statement-based logging mode where the transaction<br>
       isolation level was set to READ COMMITTED or READ<br>
       UNCOMMITTED, because InnoDB permits statement-based<br>
       replication for DML statements. However, TRUNCATE is not<br>
       transactional; since it is the equivalent of DROP TABLE<br>
       followed by CREATE TABLE, it is actually DDL, and should<br>
       therefore be allowed to be replicated as a statement.<br>
<br>
    2. TRUNCATE was not logged in mixed mode because of the<br>
       error just described; however, this error was not<br>
       reported to the client.<br>
<br>
  As a result of this fix, TRUNCATE is now treated as DDL for<br>
  purposes of binary logging and replication; that is, it is<br>
  always logged as a statement and so no longer causes an error<br>
  when replicated using a transactional storage engine such as<br>
  InnoDB. (Bug#36763: http://bugs.mysql.com/36763)<br>
  See also Bug#42643: http://bugs.mysql.com/42643.<br>
<br>
* Replication: mysqlbinlog replay of CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ...<br>
  LIKE statements and of TRUNCATE statements used on temporary<br>
  tables failed with Error 1146 (Table ... doesn't exist).<br>
  (Bug#35583: http://bugs.mysql.com/35583)<br>
<br>
* Replication: In statement mode, mysqlbinlog failed to issue a<br>
  SET @@autommit statement when the autocommit mode was changed.<br>
  (Bug#34541: http://bugs.mysql.com/34541)<br>
<br>
* Replication: LOAD DATA INFILE statements did not replicate<br>
  correctly from a master running MySQL 4.1 to a slave running<br>
  MySQL 5.1 or later. (Bug#31240: http://bugs.mysql.com/31240)<br>
<br>
* A '%' character in SQL statements could cause the server to<br>
  crash. (Bug#42634: http://bugs.mysql.com/42634)<br>
<br>
* An optimization introduced for<br>
  Bug#37553: http://bugs.mysql.com/37553 required an explicit<br>
  cast to be added for some uses of TIMEDIFF() because automatic<br>
  casting could produce incorrect results. (It was necessary to<br>
  use TIME(TIMEDIFF(...)).)<br>
  (Bug#42525: http://bugs.mysql.com/42525)<br>
<br>
* On the IBM i5 platform, the MySQL configuration process caused<br>
  the system version of pthread_setschedprio() to be used. This<br>
  function returns SIGILL on i5 because it is not supported,<br>
  causing the server to crash. Now the my_pthread_setprio()<br>
  function in the mysys library is used instead.<br>
  (Bug#42524: http://bugs.mysql.com/42524)<br>
<br>
* The SSL certficates included with MySQL distributions were<br>
  regenerated because the previous ones had expired.<br>
  (Bug#42366: http://bugs.mysql.com/42366)<br>
<br>
* User variables within triggers could cause a crash if the<br>
  mysql_change_user() C API function was invoked.<br>
  (Bug#42188: http://bugs.mysql.com/42188)<br>
<br>
* Dependent subqueries such as the following caused a memory<br>
  leak proportional to the number of outer rows:<br>
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1, t2 WHERE t2.b<br>
    IN (SELECT DISTINCT t2.b FROM t2 WHERE t2.b = t1.a);<br>
  (Bug#42037: http://bugs.mysql.com/42037)<br>
<br>
* Some queries using NAME_CONST(.. COLLATE ...) led to a server<br>
  crash due to a failed type cast.<br>
  (Bug#42014: http://bugs.mysql.com/42014)<br>
<br>
* On Mac OS X, some of the universal client libraries were not<br>
  actually universal and were missing code for one or more<br>
  architectures. (Bug#41940: http://bugs.mysql.com/41940)<br>
<br>
* String reallocation could cause memory overruns.<br>
  (Bug#41868: http://bugs.mysql.com/41868)<br>
<br>
* Setting innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog should be equivalent to<br>
  setting the transaction isolation level to READ COMMITTED.<br>
  However, if both of those things were done, non-matching<br>
  semi-consistently read rows were not unlocked when they should<br>
  have been. (Bug#41671: http://bugs.mysql.com/41671)<br>
<br>
* REPAIR TABLE crashed for compressed MyISAM tables.<br>
  (Bug#41574: http://bugs.mysql.com/41574)<br>
<br>
* For a TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT ... column, storing NULL as<br>
  the return value from some functions caused a "cannot be NULL"<br>
  error. NULL returns now correctly cause the column default<br>
  value to be stored. (Bug#41370: http://bugs.mysql.com/41370)<br>
<br>
* The server cannot execute INSERT DELAYED statements when<br>
  statement-based binary logging is enabled, but the error<br>
  message displayed only the table name, not the entire<br>
  statement. (Bug#41121: http://bugs.mysql.com/41121)<br>
<br>
* FULLTEXT indexes did not work for Unicode columns that used a<br>
  custom UCA collation. (Bug#41084: http://bugs.mysql.com/41084)<br>
<br>
* The Windows installer displayed incorrect product names in<br>
  some images. (Bug#40845: http://bugs.mysql.com/40845)<br>
<br>
* SELECT statements could be blocked by INSERT DELAYED<br>
  statements that were waiting for a lock, even with<br>
  low_priority_updates enabled.<br>
  (Bug#40536: http://bugs.mysql.com/40536)<br>
<br>
* The query cache stored only partial query results if a<br>
  statement failed while the results were being sent to the<br>
  client. This could cause other clients to hang when trying to<br>
  read the cached result. Now if a statement fails, the result<br>
  is not cached. (Bug#40264: http://bugs.mysql.com/40264)<br>
<br>
* When a MEMORY table became full, the error generated was<br>
  returned to the client but was not written to the error log.<br>
  (Bug#39886: http://bugs.mysql.com/39886)<br>
<br>
* The expression ROW(...) IN (SELECT ... FROM DUAL) always<br>
  returned TRUE. (Bug#39069: http://bugs.mysql.com/39069)<br>
<br>
* The greedy optimizer could cause a server crash due to<br>
  improper handling of nested outer joins.<br>
  (Bug#38795: http://bugs.mysql.com/38795)<br>
<br>
* Use of COUNT(DISTINCT) prevented NULL testing in the HAVING<br>
  clause. (Bug#38637: http://bugs.mysql.com/38637)<br>
<br>
* Enabling the sync_frm system variable had no effect on the<br>
  handling of .frm files for views.<br>
  (Bug#38145: http://bugs.mysql.com/38145)<br>
<br>
* Setting myisam_repair_threads greater than 1 caused a server<br>
  crash for table repair or alteration operations for MyISAM<br>
  tables with multiple FULLTEXT indexes.<br>
  (Bug#37756: http://bugs.mysql.com/37756)<br>
<br>
* The mysql client sometimes improperly interpreted string<br>
  escape sequences in non-string contexts.<br>
  (Bug#36391: http://bugs.mysql.com/36391)<br>
<br>
* The query cache stored packets containing the server status of<br>
  the time when the cached statement was run. This might lead to<br>
  an incorrect transaction status on the client side if a<br>
  statement was cached during a transaction and later served<br>
  outside a transaction context (or vice versa).<br>
  (Bug#36326: http://bugs.mysql.com/36326)<br>
<br>
* If the system time was adjusted backward during query<br>
  execution, the apparent execution time could be negative. But<br>
  in some cases these queries would be written to the slow query<br>
  log, with the negative execution time written as a large<br>
  unsigned number. Now statements with apparent negative<br>
  execution time are not written to the slow query log.<br>
  (Bug#35396: http://bugs.mysql.com/35396)<br>
<br>
* libmysqld was not built with all character sets.<br>
  (Bug#32831: http://bugs.mysql.com/32831)<br>
<br>
* For mysqld_multi, using the --mysqld=mysqld_safe option caused<br>
  the --defaults-file and --defaults-extra-file options to<br>
  behave the same way. (Bug#32136: http://bugs.mysql.com/32136)<br>
<br>
* For Solaris package installation using pkgadd, the postinstall<br>
  script failed, causing the system tables in the mysql database<br>
  not to be created. (Bug#31164: http://bugs.mysql.com/31164)<br>
<br>
* If the default database was dropped, the value of<br>
  character_set_database was not reset to character_set_server<br>
  as it should have been.<br>
