-------<br>
以下チェンジログ(6.0.9-alpha)：<br>
<br>
■機能の追加と変更(6.0.9-alpha)：<br>
<br>
* BACKUP DATABASE and RESTORE now indicate in the server's error<br>
  log which databases are being backed up or restored.<br>
  (Bug#40307: http://bugs.mysql.com/40307)<br>
<br>
* Performance of SELECT * retrievals from<br>
  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS was improved slightly.<br>
  (Bug#38918: http://bugs.mysql.com/38918)<br>
<br>
* Previously, index hints did not work for FULLTEXT searches.<br>
  Now they work as follows:<br>
  For natural language mode searches, index hints are silently<br>
  ignored. For example, IGNORE INDEX(i) is ignored with no<br>
  warning and the index is still used.<br>
  For boolean mode searches, index hints with FOR ORDER BY or<br>
  FOR GROUP BY are silently ignored. Index hints with FOR JOIN<br>
  or no FOR modifier are honored. In contrast to how hints apply<br>
  for non-FULLTEXT searches, the hint is used for all phases of<br>
  query execution (finding rows and retrieval, grouping, and<br>
  ordering). This is true even if the hint is given for a<br>
  non-FULLTEXT index. (Bug#38842: http://bugs.mysql.com/38842)<br>
<br>
* MySQL support for adding collations using LDML specifications<br>
  did not support the <i> identity rule that indicates one<br>
  character sorts identically to another. The <i> rule now is<br>
  supported. (Bug#37129: http://bugs.mysql.com/37129)<br>
<br>
* Previously, RESTORE overwrote any databases with information<br>
  from the backup image. Now, RESTORE aborts with an error if<br>
  the backup image contains any databases that currently exist<br>
  on the server, unless the optional keyword OVERWRITE is given<br>
  following the image filename.<br>
  (Bug#34579: http://bugs.mysql.com/34579)<br>
<br>
* A new statement, PURGE BACKUP LOGS, enables the contents of<br>
  the MySQL Backup logs to be culled. See Section 12.5.3.2,<br>
  "PURGE BACKUP LOGS Syntax."<br>
  (Bug#33364: http://bugs.mysql.com/33364)<br>
<br>
<br>
■バグ修正(6.0.9-alpha)：<br>
<br>
* Security Enhancement: When the DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX<br>
  DIRECTORY clause of a CREATE TABLE statement referred to a<br>
  subdirectory of the data directory via a symlinked component<br>
  of the data directory path, it was accepted, when for security<br>
  reasons it should be rejected.<br>
  (Bug#39277: http://bugs.mysql.com/39277)<br>
<br>
* Incompatible Change: CHECK TABLE ... FOR UPGRADE did not check<br>
  for collation changes made in MySQL 6.0.1 to latin2_czech_cs<br>
  or collation changes made in MySQL 6.0.6 to big5_chinese_ci,<br>
  cp866_general_ci, gb2312_chinese_ci, and gbk_chinese_ci. (This<br>
  also affects mysqlcheck and mysql_upgrade, which cause that<br>
  statement to be executed.)<br>
  (Bug#40054: http://bugs.mysql.com/40054)<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: Replication: Changing the transaction isolation<br>
  level while replicating partitioned InnoDB tables could cause<br>
  statement-based logging to fail.<br>
  (Bug#39084: http://bugs.mysql.com/39084)<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: This bug was introduced in MySQL 6.0.5.<br>
  (Bug#40954: http://bugs.mysql.com/40954)<br>
  This regression was introduced by<br>
  Bug#30573: http://bugs.mysql.com/30573,<br>
  Bug#33257: http://bugs.mysql.com/33257,<br>
  Bug#33555: http://bugs.mysql.com/33555.<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: With READ COMMITTED transaction isolation level,<br>
  InnoDB uses a semi-consistent read that releases non-matching<br>
  rows after MySQL has evaluated the WHERE clause. However, this<br>
  was not happening if the table used partitions.<br>
  (Bug#40595: http://bugs.mysql.com/40595)<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: A SELECT using a range WHERE condition with an<br>
  ORDER BY on a partitioned table caused a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#40494: http://bugs.mysql.com/40494)<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: For a partitioned table having an AUTO_INCREMENT<br>
  column: If the first statement following a start of the server<br>
  or a FLUSH TABLES statement was an UPDATE statement, the<br>
  AUTO_INCREMENT column was not incremented correctly.<br>
  (Bug#40176: http://bugs.mysql.com/40176)<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: The server attempted to execute the statements<br>
  ALTER TABLE ... ANALYZE PARTITION, ALTER TABLE ... CHECK<br>
  PARTITION, ALTER TABLE ... OPTIMIZE PARTITION, and ALTER TABLE<br>
  ... REORGANIZE PARTITION on tables that were not partitioned.<br>
  (Bug#39434: http://bugs.mysql.com/39434)<br>
  See also Bug#20129: http://bugs.mysql.com/20129.<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: The value of the CREATE_COLUMNS column in<br>
  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES was not partitioned for partitioned<br>
  tables. (Bug#38909: http://bugs.mysql.com/38909)<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: When executing an ORDER BY query on a<br>
  partitioned InnoDB table using an index that was not in the<br>
  partition expression, the results were sorted on a<br>
  per-partition basis rather than for the table as a whole.<br>
  (Bug#37721: http://bugs.mysql.com/37721)<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: Partitioned table checking sometimes returned a<br>
  warning with an error code of 0, making proper response to<br>
  errors impossible. The fix also renders the error message<br>
  subject to translation in non-English deployments.<br>
  (Bug#36768: http://bugs.mysql.com/36768)<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: When SHOW CREATE TABLE was used on a partitioned<br>
  table, all of the table's PARTITION and SUBPARTITION clauses<br>
  were output on a single line, making it difficult to read or<br>
  parse. (Bug#14326: http://bugs.mysql.com/14326)<br>
<br>
* Replication: Row-based replication failed with non-partitioned<br>
  MyISAM tables having no indexes.<br>
  (Bug#40004: http://bugs.mysql.com/40004)<br>
<br>
* An assertion failure occurred for a join query when a small<br>
  size of the join buffer was set and the value of<br>
  record_per_key for the index used for a ref access with this<br>
  join buffer was big enough.<br>
  (Bug#41204: http://bugs.mysql.com/41204)<br>
<br>
* Unique indexes on FALCON tables can not be created when the<br>
  the column is NOT NULL.<br>
  (Bug#40994: http://bugs.mysql.com/40994)<br>
<br>
* Accessing user variables within triggers could cause a server<br>
  crash. (Bug#40770: http://bugs.mysql.com/40770)<br>
<br>
* For single-table UPDATE statements, an assertion failure<br>
  resulted from a runtime error in a stored function (such as a<br>
  recursive function call or an attempt to update the same table<br>
  as in the UPDATE statement).<br>
  (Bug#40745: http://bugs.mysql.com/40745)<br>
<br>
* Date values of 000-00-00 inserted into a FALCON table were<br>
  incorrectly recognized and returned when performing a SELECT<br>
  on a field with an index.<br>
  (Bug#40614: http://bugs.mysql.com/40614)<br>
<br>
* Several MySQL Backup-related memory-use issues identified by<br>
  Valgrind were corrected.<br>
  (Bug#40480: http://bugs.mysql.com/40480)<br>
<br>
* When executing concurrent CREATE TABLE ... SELECT statements<br>
  on a Maria table, the error Error: Memory allocated at<br>
  trnman.c:129 was underrun, discovered at ma_close.c:65 error<br>
  would be logged in the error file, and the server would<br>
  eventually crash. (Bug#40416: http://bugs.mysql.com/40416)<br>
<br>
* Prepared statements allowed invalid dates to be inserted when<br>
  the ALLOW_INVALID_DATES SQL mode was not enabled.<br>
  (Bug#40365: http://bugs.mysql.com/40365)<br>
<br>
* With statement-based binary logging format and a transaction<br>
  isolation level of READ COMMITTED or stricter, InnoDB printed<br>
  an error because statement-based logging might lead to<br>
  inconsistency between master and slave databases. However,<br>
  this error was printed even when binary logging was not<br>
  enabled (in which case, no such inconsistency can occur).<br>
  (Bug#40360: http://bugs.mysql.com/40360)<br>
<br>
* A query with an outer join where the ON expression evaluated<br>
  to the constant FALSE could return incorrect results when a<br>
  join buffer was used for the outer join operation.<br>
  (Bug#40317: http://bugs.mysql.com/40317)<br>
<br>
* Errors from a BACKUP DATABASE or RESTORE operation were shown<br>
  by SHOW WARNINGS as warnings, not errors.<br>
  (Bug#40304: http://bugs.mysql.com/40304)<br>
<br>
* If several errors occurred during a BACKUP DATABASE or RESTORE<br>
  operation, the final error was returned to the client, even<br>
  though the first error is usually more pertinent.<br>
  (Bug#40303: http://bugs.mysql.com/40303)<br>
<br>
* Creation of a tablespace file within FALCON could create a<br>
  tablespace entry in the<br>
  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FALCON_TABLESPACE_IO even the underlying<br>
  data file had not been created.<br>
  (Bug#40302: http://bugs.mysql.com/40302)<br>
<br>
* Specifying the --log-backup-output option without an argument<br>
  set the destination for the backup logs to FILE rather than to<br>
  the default of TABLE. (Bug#40282: http://bugs.mysql.com/40282)<br>
<br>
* mc.exe is no longer needed to compile MySQL on Windows. This<br>
  makes it possible to build MySQL from source using Visual<br>
  Studio Express 2008. (Bug#40280: http://bugs.mysql.com/40280)<br>
<br>
* The server could generate extra rows in the result set for a<br>
  query with a nested outer join if the inner tables of the<br>
  outer join were joined using join buffers.<br>
  (Bug#40268: http://bugs.mysql.com/40268)<br>
<br>
* If BACKUP DATABASE was used to back up an empty database and<br>
  binary logging enabled, the backup image was flagged as<br>
  containing binary log information even though it did not.<br>
  Using RESTORE with the backup image then crashed trying to<br>
  parse the binary log filename.<br>
  (Bug#40262: http://bugs.mysql.com/40262)<br>
<br>
* The backup_history_log_file and backup_progress_log_file<br>
  system variables were not settable at server startup. Now they<br>
  are. (Bug#40219: http://bugs.mysql.com/40219)<br>
<br>
* The default value of the backup_history_log and<br>
  backup_progress_log system variables is ON, but explicitly<br>
  setting them to DEFAULT set them to OFF.<br>
  (Bug#40218: http://bugs.mysql.com/40218)<br>
<br>
* When an outer join employed a join buffer to join the first<br>
  inner table by the Blocked Nested Loops algorithm, extra<br>
  NULL-complemented rows could be generated if the WHERE clause<br>
  contained conditions that can be pushed down to this table.<br>
  (Bug#40192: http://bugs.mysql.com/40192)<br>
<br>
* When the optimizer joined an inner table of an outer join<br>
  using both "not exists" optimization and a join buffer, an<br>
  incorrect result set could be returned.<br>
  (Bug#40134: http://bugs.mysql.com/40134)<br>
<br>
* Support for the revision field in .frm files has been removed.<br>
  This addresses the downgrading problem introduced by the fix<br>
  for Bug#17823: http://bugs.mysql.com/17823.<br>
  (Bug#40021: http://bugs.mysql.com/40021)<br>
<br>
* The MySQL Backup message logger caused an assertion failure.<br>
  (Bug#39997: http://bugs.mysql.com/39997)<br>
<br>
* Retrieval speed from the following INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables<br>
  was improved by shortening the VARIABLE_VALUE column to 1024<br>
  characters: GLOBAL_VARIABLES, SESSION_VARIABLES,<br>
  GLOBAL_STATUS, and SESSION_STATUS.<br>
  As a result of this change, any variable value longer than<br>
  1024 characters will be truncated with a warning. This affects<br>
  only the init_connect system variable.<br>
  (Bug#39955: http://bugs.mysql.com/39955)<br>
<br>
* If the operating system is configured to return leap seconds<br>
  from OS time calls or if the MySQL server uses a time zone<br>
  definition that has leap seconds, functions such as NOW()<br>
  could return a value having a time part that ends with :59:60<br>
  or :59:61. If such values are inserted into a table, they<br>
  would be dumped as is by mysqldump but considered invalid when<br>
  reloaded, leading to backup/restore problems.<br>
  Now leap second values are returned with a time part that ends<br>
  with :59:59. This means that a function such as NOW() can<br>
  return the same value for two or three consecutive seconds<br>
  during the leap second. It remains true that literal temporal<br>
  values having a time part that ends with :59:60 or :59:61 are<br>
  considered invalid.<br>
  For additional details about leap-second handling, see Section<br>
  9.7.2, "Time Zone Leap Second Support."<br>
  (Bug#39920: http://bugs.mysql.com/39920)<br>
<br>
* The server could crash during a sort-order optimization of a<br>
  dependent subquery. (Bug#39844: http://bugs.mysql.com/39844)<br>
<br>
* Recovery of a tablespace for FALCON tables could fail if the<br>
  tablespace was already in use.<br>
  (Bug#39789: http://bugs.mysql.com/39789)<br>
<br>
* Creating a FALCON table while specifying a specific tablespace<br>
  and partition to be used for the table will fail if the<br>
  specified tablespace does not already exist, returning a error<br>
  indicating general table creation failure. The message has<br>
  been updated to indicate that the failure is due to<br>
  non-existent tablespace.<br>
  (Bug#39702: http://bugs.mysql.com/39702)<br>
<br>
* With the ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY SQL mode enabled, the check for<br>
  non-aggregated columns in queries with aggregate functions,<br>
  but without a GROUP BY clause was treating all the parts of<br>
  the query as if they were in the select list. This is fixed by<br>
  ignoring the non-aggregated columns in the WHERE clause.<br>
  (Bug#39656: http://bugs.mysql.com/39656)<br>
<br>
* Concurrent execution of BACKUP DATABASE and DML operations on<br>
  MyISAM tables could produce a deadlock.<br>
  (Bug#39602: http://bugs.mysql.com/39602)<br>
<br>
* CHECK TABLE failed for MyISAM INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables.<br>
  (Bug#39541: http://bugs.mysql.com/39541)<br>
<br>
* On 64-bit Windows systems, the server accepted key_buffer_size<br>
  values larger than 4GB, but allocated less. (For example,<br>
  specifying a value of 5GB resulted in 1GB being allocated.)<br>
  (Bug#39494: http://bugs.mysql.com/39494)<br>
<br>
* Compiling MySQL with FALCON support enabled with a compiler<br>
  that does not support exceptions would fail to complete<br>
  successfully. configure has been updated to switch off FALCON<br>
  support if the specified compiler does not support exceptions.<br>
  (Bug#39419: http://bugs.mysql.com/39419)<br>
<br>
* Use of the PACK_KEYS or MAX_ROWS table option in ALTER TABLE<br>
  should have triggered table reconstruction but did not.<br>
  (Bug#39372: http://bugs.mysql.com/39372)<br>
<br>
* The server returned a column type of VARBINARY rather than<br>
  DATE as the result from the COALESCE(), IFNULL(), IF(),<br>
  GREATEST(), or LEAST() functions or CASE expression if the<br>
  result was obtained using filesort in an anonymous temporary<br>
  table during the query execution.<br>
  (Bug#39283: http://bugs.mysql.com/39283)<br>
<br>
* Starting MySQL with FALCON support when MySQL has not been<br>
  compiled with a compiler supporting exceptions would lead to<br>
  strange errors and results. MySQL will now fail to initialize<br>
  if you have compiled without exceptions enabled with the<br>
  following message: 081116 12:21:12 [ERROR] Falcon must be<br>
  compiled with C++ exceptions enabled to work. Please adjust<br>
  your compile flags.  [Falcon] Error: Falcon exiting process<br>
  (Bug#39260: http://bugs.mysql.com/39260)<br>
<br>
* A server built using yaSSL for SSL support would crash if<br>
  configured to use an RSA key and a client sent a cipher list<br>
  containing a non-RSA key as acceptable.<br>
  (Bug#39178: http://bugs.mysql.com/39178)<br>
<br>
* When built with Valgrind, the server failed to access tables<br>
  created with the DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY table<br>
  option. (Bug#39102: http://bugs.mysql.com/39102)<br>
<br>
* With binary logging enabled CREATE VIEW was subject to<br>
  possible buffer overwrite and a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#39040: http://bugs.mysql.com/39040)<br>
<br>
* The fast mutex implementation was subject to excessive lock<br>
  contention. (Bug#38941: http://bugs.mysql.com/38941)<br>
<br>
* Use of InnoDB monitoring (SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS or one of<br>
  the InnoDB Monitor tables) could cause a server crash due to<br>
  invalid access to a shared variable in a concurrent<br>
  environment. (Bug#38883: http://bugs.mysql.com/38883)<br>
<br>
* Column names constructed due to wild-card expansion done<br>
  inside a stored procedure could point to freed memory if the<br>
  expansion was performed after the first call to the stored<br>
  procedure. (Bug#38823: http://bugs.mysql.com/38823)<br>
<br>
* If delayed insert failed to upgrade the lock, it did not free<br>
  the temporary memory storage used to keep newly constructed<br>
  BLOB values in memory, resulting in a memory leak.<br>
  (Bug#38693: http://bugs.mysql.com/38693)<br>
<br>
* The server unnecessarily acquired a query cache mutex even<br>
  with the query cache disabled, resulting in a small<br>
  performance decrement.<br>
  (Bug#38551: http://bugs.mysql.com/38551)<br>
<br>
* On Windows, a five-second delay occurred at shutdown of<br>
  applications that used the embedded server.<br>
  (Bug#38522: http://bugs.mysql.com/38522)<br>
<br>
* On Solaris, a scheduling policy applied to the main server<br>
  process could be unintentionally overwritten in<br>
  client-servicing threads.<br>
  (Bug#38477: http://bugs.mysql.com/38477)<br>
<br>
* BACKUP DATABASE failed to use the native driver for a Falcon<br>
  table if the table was partitioned.<br>
  (Bug#38426: http://bugs.mysql.com/38426)<br>
<br>
* On Windows, the embedded server would crash in<br>
  mysql_library_init() if the language file was missing.<br>
  (Bug#38293: http://bugs.mysql.com/38293)<br>
<br>
* The Event Scheduler no longer logs "started in thread" or<br>
  "executed" successfully messages to the error log.<br>
  (Bug#38066: http://bugs.mysql.com/38066)<br>
<br>
* Setting the debug system variable and executing a SELECT<br>
  statement resulted in a Valgrind warning.<br>
  (Bug#38023: http://bugs.mysql.com/38023)<br>
<br>
* An incorrectly checked XOR subquery optimization resulted in<br>
  an assertion failure. (Bug#37899: http://bugs.mysql.com/37899)<br>
<br>
* A SELECT with a NULL NOT IN condition containing a complex<br>
  subquery from the same table as in the outer select caused an<br>
  assertion failure. (Bug#37894: http://bugs.mysql.com/37894)<br>
<br>
* Use of an uninitialized constant in EXPLAIN evaluation caused<br>
  an assertion failure. (Bug#37870: http://bugs.mysql.com/37870)<br>
<br>
* A query that could use one index to produce the desired<br>
  ordering and another index for range access with index<br>
  condition pushdown could cause a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#37851: http://bugs.mysql.com/37851)<br>
<br>
* Renaming an ARCHIVE table to the same name with different<br>
  lettercase and then selecting from it could cause a server<br>
  crash. (Bug#37719: http://bugs.mysql.com/37719)<br>
<br>
* For queries executed with the batched-key access method, an<br>
  incorrect value of an internal parameter caused a server<br>
  crashe if join_buffer_size was less then 256.<br>
  (Bug#37690: http://bugs.mysql.com/37690)<br>
<br>
* Compiling MySQL with FALCON support enabled on Solaris 9 using<br>
  the Sun Studio compiler would fail with error: "Interlock.h",<br>
  line 149: Error: #error cas not defined. We need>= Solaris 10.<br>
  (Bug#37622: http://bugs.mysql.com/37622)<br>
<br>
* TIMEDIFF() was erroneously treated as always returning a<br>
  positive result. Also, CAST() of TIME values to DECIMAL<br>
  dropped the sign of negative values.<br>
  (Bug#37553: http://bugs.mysql.com/37553)<br>
<br>
* mysqlcheck used SHOW FULL TABLES to get the list of tables in<br>
  a database. For some problems, such as an empty .frm file for<br>
  a table, this would fail and mysqlcheck then would neglect to<br>
  check other tables in the database.<br>
  (Bug#37527: http://bugs.mysql.com/37527)<br>
<br>
* Updating a view with a subquery in the CHECK option could<br>
  cause an assertion failure.<br>
  (Bug#37460: http://bugs.mysql.com/37460)<br>
<br>
* Statements that displayed the value of system variables (for<br>
  example, SHOW VARIABLES) expect variable values to be encoded<br>
  in character_set_system. However, variables set from the<br>
  command line such as basedir or datadir were encoded using<br>
  character_set_filesystem and not converted correctly.<br>
  (Bug#37339: http://bugs.mysql.com/37339)<br>
<br>
* On a 32-bit server built without big tables support, the<br>
  offset argument in a LIMIT clause might be truncated due to a<br>
  64-bit to 32-bit cast.<br>
  (Bug#37075: http://bugs.mysql.com/37075)<br>
<br>
* Specifying a database name twice to BACKUP DATABASE caused a<br>
  server crash. Now BACKUP DATABASE ignores duplicate names.<br>
  (Bug#36933: http://bugs.mysql.com/36933)<br>
<br>
* If a non-directory file f without an extension was created in<br>
  the data directory, the server would allow clients to execute<br>
  a USE f statement even though f could not be a database. The<br>
  server now verifies that that the named database corresponds<br>
  to a directory. (Bug#36897: http://bugs.mysql.com/36897)<br>
<br>
* The FALCON storage would silently recreate missing tablespace<br>
  files if they did not exist. Errors are now written to the<br>
  MySQL error log when the FALCON system tablespace files are<br>
  found to be missing. Warnings are produce in the log file when<br>
  attempting to access data tablespace files that do not exist.<br>
  (Bug#36804: http://bugs.mysql.com/36804)<br>
<br>
* Use of CONVERT() with GROUP BY to convert numeric values to<br>
  CHAR could return truncated results.<br>
  (Bug#36772: http://bugs.mysql.com/36772)<br>
<br>
* The mysql client, when built with Visual Studio 2005, did not<br>
  display Japanese characters.<br>
  (Bug#36279: http://bugs.mysql.com/36279)<br>
<br>
* Setting the slave_compressed_protocol system variable to<br>
  DEFAULT failed in the embedded server.<br>
  (Bug#35999: http://bugs.mysql.com/35999)<br>
<br>
* Processing for NULL-complemented rows in the result sets of<br>
  queries with nested outer joins could be incorrect.<br>
  (Bug#35835: http://bugs.mysql.com/35835)<br>

* The columns that store character set and collation names in<br>
  several INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables were lengthened because they<br>
  were not long enough to store some possible values: SCHEMATA,<br>
  TABLES, COLUMNS, CHARACTER_SETS, COLLATIONS, and<br>
  COLLATION_CHARACTER_SET_APPLICABILITY.<br>
  (Bug#35789: http://bugs.mysql.com/35789)<br>
<br>
* Queries executed using the batched-key access method could<br>
  cause an assertion fail when key expressions for a ref access<br>
  depended on columns not only from the previous join table.<br>
  (Bug#35685: http://bugs.mysql.com/35685)<br>
<br>
* Selecting from an INFORMATION_SCHEMA table into an incorrectly<br>
  defined MERGE table caused an assertion failure.<br>
  (Bug#35068: http://bugs.mysql.com/35068)<br>
<br>
* perror on Windows did not know about Win32 system error codes.<br>
  (Bug#34825: http://bugs.mysql.com/34825)<br>
<br>
* EXPLAIN EXTENDED evaluation of aggregate functions that<br>
  required a temporary table caused a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#34773: http://bugs.mysql.com/34773)<br>
<br>
* BACKUP DATABASE produced an incorrect error message when the<br>
  backup image filename contained a non-existent directory.<br>
  (Bug#34754: http://bugs.mysql.com/34754)<br>
<br>
* SHOW GLOBAL STATUS shows values that aggregate the session<br>
  status values for all threads. This did not work correctly for<br>
  the embedded server. (Bug#34517: http://bugs.mysql.com/34517)<br>
<br>
* There were spurious warnings about "Truncated incorrect DOUBLE<br>
  value" in queries with MATCH ... AGAINST and > or < with a<br>
  constant (which was reported as an incorrect DOUBLE value) in<br>
  the WHERE condition. (Bug#34374: http://bugs.mysql.com/34374)<br>
<br>
* mysqldumpslow did not aggregate times.<br>
  (Bug#34129: http://bugs.mysql.com/34129)<br>
<br>
* mysql_config did not output -ldl (or equivalent) when needed<br>
  for --libmysqld-libs, so its output could be insufficient to<br>
  build applications that use the embedded server.<br>
  (Bug#34025: http://bugs.mysql.com/34025)<br>
<br>
* For a stored procedure containing a SELECT * ... RIGHT JOIN<br>
  query, execution failed for the second call.<br>
  (Bug#33811: http://bugs.mysql.com/33811)<br>
<br>
* The ROUTINES.DATA_TYPE,<br>
  REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS.SPECIFIC_SCHEMA,<br>
  REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS.SPECIFIC_NAME,<br>
  REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS.PARAMETER_NAME,<br>
  REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS.DATA_TYPE columns were declared longer<br>
  than the maximum allowed identifier length.<br>
  (Bug#33649: http://bugs.mysql.com/33649)<br>
<br>
* If a TEMPORARY table existed with the same name as a regular<br>
  table, BACKUP DATABASE saved the temporary table, causing a<br>
  subsequent RESTORE to fail.<br>
  (Bug#33574: http://bugs.mysql.com/33574)<br>
<br>
* Previously, use of index hints with views (which do not have<br>
  indexes) produced the error ERROR 1221 (HY000): Incorrect<br>
  usage of USE/IGNORE INDEX and VIEW. Now this produces ERROR<br>
  1176 (HY000): Key '...' doesn't exist in table '...', the same<br>
  error as for base tables without an appropriate index.<br>
  (Bug#33461: http://bugs.mysql.com/33461)<br>
<br>
* Execution of a prepared statement that referred to a system<br>
  variable caused a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#32124: http://bugs.mysql.com/32124)<br>
<br>
* Some division operations produced a result with incorrect<br>
  precision. (Bug#31616: http://bugs.mysql.com/31616)<br>
<br>
* Server variables could not be set to their current values on<br>
  Linux platforms. (These fixes are in addition to those made in<br>
  MySQL 6.0.5.) (Bug#31177: http://bugs.mysql.com/31177)<br>
  See also Bug#6958: http://bugs.mysql.com/6958.<br>
<br>
* Searching for text values on a column using a character set<br>
  that provides multi-weight characters and sequences on an<br>
  INNODB or FALCON table with an index would fail to find the<br>
  expanded value. (Bug#29246: http://bugs.mysql.com/29246)<br>
<br>
* Some SHOW statements and retrievals from the<br>
  INFORMATION_SCHEMA TRIGGERS and EVENTS tables used a temporary<br>
  table and incremented the Created_tmp_disk_tables status<br>
  variable, due to the way that TEXT columns are handled. The<br>
  TRIGGERS.SQL_MODE, TRIGGERS.DEFINER, and EVENTS.SQL_MODE<br>
  columns now are VARCHAR to avoid this problem.<br>
  (Bug#29153: http://bugs.mysql.com/29153)<br>
<br>
* XA transaction rollbacks could result in corrupted transaction<br>
  states and a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#28323: http://bugs.mysql.com/28323)<br>
<br>
* There were cases where string-to-number conversions would<br>
  produce warnings for CHAR values but not for VARCHAR values.<br>
  (Bug#28299: http://bugs.mysql.com/28299)<br>
<br>
* For several read only system variables that were viewable with<br>
  SHOW VARIABLES, attempting to view them with SELECT @@var_name<br>
  or set their values with SET resulted in an unknown system<br>
  variable error. Now they can be viewed with SELECT @@var_name<br>
  and attempting to set their values results in a message<br>
  indicating that they are read only.<br>
  (Bug#28234: http://bugs.mysql.com/28234)<br>
<br>
* ALTER TABLE for an ENUM column could change column values.<br>
  (Bug#23113: http://bugs.mysql.com/23113)<br>
<br>
* Setting the session value of the max_allowed_packet or<br>
  net_buffer_length system variable was allowed but had no<br>
  effect. The session value of these variables is now read only.<br>
  (Bug#22891: http://bugs.mysql.com/22891)<br>
<br>
* A race condition between the mysqld.exe server and the Windows<br>
  service manager could lead to inability to stop the server<br>
  from the service manager.<br>
