以下チェンジログ：<br>
■機能の追加と変更(6.0.8-alph)：<br>
<br>
* Incompatible Change: The tables for MySQL Backup logging have<br>
  been renamed, and the logging capabilities now are more<br>
  flexible, similar to the capabilities provided for the general<br>
  query log and slow query log.<br>
<br>
     + The names of the MySQL Backup log tables in the mysql<br>
       database have been changed from 'online_backup' and<br>
       'online_backup_progress' to 'backup_history' and<br>
       'backup_progress'.<br>
<br>
     + Logging now can be enabled or disabled, it is possible to<br>
       log to tables or to files, and the names of the log files<br>
       can be changed. For details, see Section 6.3.3.1, "MySQL<br>
       Backup Log Control."<br>
<br>
     + A new statement, FLUSH BACKUP LOGS, closes and reopens<br>
       the backup log files. A new option for mysql_refresh(),<br>
       REFRESH_BACKUP_LOG, performs the same operation.<br>
<br>
* Important Change: The '--skip-thread-priority' option is now<br>
  deprecated in MySQL 5.1 and is removed in MySQL 6.0 such that<br>
  the server won't change the thread priorities by default.<br>
<br>
  Giving threads different priorities might yield marginal<br>
  improvements in some platforms (where it actually works), but<br>
  it might instead cause significant degradation depending on<br>
  the thread count and number of processors. Meddling with the<br>
  thread priorities is a not a safe bet as it is very dependent<br>
  on the behavior of the CPU scheduler and system where MySQL is<br>
  being run.<br>
  (Bug#35164: http://bugs.mysql.com/35164,<br>
   Bug#37536: http://bugs.mysql.com/37536)<br>
<br>
* Important Change: The '--log' option now is deprecated and will<br>
  be removed (along with the log system variable) in the future.<br>
  Instead, use the '--general_log' option to enable the general<br>
  query log and the '--general_log_file=file_name' option to set<br>
  the general query log filename. The values of these options<br>
  are available in the general_log and 'general_log_file' system<br>
  variables, which can be changed at runtime.<br>
<br>
  Similar changes were made for the '--log-slow-queries' option<br>
  and 'log_slow_queries' system variable. You should use the<br>
  '--slow_query_log' and '--slow_query_log_file=file_name' options<br>
  instead (and the 'slow_query_log' and 'slow_query_log_file' system<br>
  variables).<br>
<br>
* The "BUILD/compile-solaris-*" scripts now compile MySQL with the<br>
  mtmalloc library rather than malloc.<br>
  (Bug#38727: http://bugs.mysql.com/38727)<br>
<br>
* BACKUP DATABASE now performs an implicit commit, like RESTORE.<br>
  (Bug#38261: http://bugs.mysql.com/38261)<br>
<br>
* The deprecated '--default-table-type' server option has been<br>
  removed. (Bug#34818: http://bugs.mysql.com/34818)<br>
<br>
* On WIndows, use of POSIX I/O interfaces in mysys was replaced<br>
  with Win32 API calls (CreateFile(), WriteFile(), and so forth)<br>
  and the default maximum number of open files has been<br>
  increased to 16384. The maximum can be increased further by<br>
  using the '--max-open-files=N' option at server startup.<br>
  (Bug#24509: http://bugs.mysql.com/24509)<br>
<br>
* Most statements that previously caused an implicit commit<br>
  before executing now also cause an implicit commit after<br>
  executing. Also, the FLUSH statement and mysql_refresh() C API<br>
  function now cause an implicit commit. See Section 12.4.3,<br>
  "Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit."<br>
<br>
<br>
■バグ修正(6.0.8-alpha)<br>
* Incompatible Change: Replication: The default binary logging<br>
  mode has been changed from MIXED to STATEMENT for<br>
  compatibility with MySQL 5.0.<br>
  (Bug#39812: http://bugs.mysql.com/39812)<br>
<br>
* Incompatible Change: In connection with view creation, the<br>
  server created arc directories inside database directories and<br>
  maintained useless copies of .frm files there. Creation and<br>
  renaming procedures of those copies as well as creation of arc<br>
  directories has been discontinued.<br>
<br>
  This change does cause a problem when downgrading to older<br>
  server versions which manifests itself under these circumstances:<br>
<br>
    1. Create a view 'v_orig' in MySQL 6.0.8 or higher.<br>
    2. Rename the view to 'v_new' and then back to 'v_orig'.<br>
    3. Downgrade to an older 6.0.x server and run "mysql_upgrade".<br>
    4. Try to rename 'v_orig' to 'v_new' again. This operation<br>
       fails.<br>
<br>
  As a workaround to avoid this problem, use either of these<br>
  approaches:<br>
<br>
     + Dump your data using mysqldump before downgrading and<br>
       reload the dump file after downgrading.<br>
     + Instead of renaming a view after the downgrade, drop it<br>
       and recreate it.<br>
<br>
  (Bug#17823: http://bugs.mysql.com/17823)<br>
  See also Bug#40021: http://bugs.mysql.com/40021<br>
<br>
* Important Change: Replication: The SUPER privilege is now<br>
  required to change the session value of 'binlog_format' as well<br>
  as its global value. For more information about 'binlog_format',<br>
  see Section 15.1.2, "Replication Formats."<br>
  (Bug#39106: http://bugs.mysql.com/39106)<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: Replication: Replication to partitioned MyISAM<br>
  tables could be slow with row-based binary logging.<br>
  (Bug#35843: http://bugs.mysql.com/35843)<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: A duplicate key error raised when inserting into<br>
  a partitioned table used a different error code from that<br>
  returned by such an error raised when inserting into a table<br>
  that was not partitioned.<br>
  (Bug#38719: http://bugs.mysql.com/38719)<br>
  See also Bug#28842: http://bugs.mysql.com/28842<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: If an error occurred when evaluating a column of<br>
  a partitioned table for the partitioning function, the row<br>
  could be inserted anyway.<br>
  (Bug#38083: http://bugs.mysql.com/38083)<br>
<br>
* Partitioning: Using INSERT ... SELECT to insert records into a<br>
  partitioned MyISAM table could fail if some partitions were<br>
  empty and others are not.<br>
  (Bug#38005: http://bugs.mysql.com/38005)<br>
<br>
* Replication: Replication of BLACKHOLE tables did not work with<br>
  row-based binary logging.<br>
  (Bug#38360: http://bugs.mysql.com/38360)<br>
<br>
* Replication: In some cases, a replication master sent a<br>
  special event to a reconnecting slave to keep the slave's<br>
  temporary tables, but they still had references to the "old"<br>
  slave SQL thread and used them to access that thread's data.<br>
  (Bug#38269: http://bugs.mysql.com/38269)<br>
<br>
* Replication: Replication filtering rules were inappropiately<br>
  applied when executing BINLOG pseudo-queries. One way in which<br>
  this problem showed itself was that, when replaying a binary<br>
  log with mysqlbinlog, RBR events were sometimes not executed<br>
  if the '--replicate-do-db' option was specified. Now replication<br>
  rules are applied only to those events executed by the slave<br>
  SQL thread. (Bug#36099: http://bugs.mysql.com/36099)<br>
<br>
* Replication: For a CREATE TABLE ... SELECT statement that<br>
  creates a table in a database other than the current one, the<br>
  table could be created in the wrong database on replication<br>
  slaves if row-based binary logging is used.<br>
  (Bug#34707: http://bugs.mysql.com/34707)<br>
<br>
* Replication: A statement did not always commit or roll back<br>
  correctly when the server was shut down; the error could be<br>
  triggered by having a failing UPDATE or INSERT statement on a<br>
  transactional table, causing an implicit rollback.<br>
  (Bug#32709: http://bugs.mysql.com/32709)<br>
  See also Bug#38262: http://bugs.mysql.com/38262<br>
<br>
* Windows builds were missing the MySQL Backup log tables.<br>
  (Bug#40126: http://bugs.mysql.com/40126)<br>
<br>
* Non-ASCII error messages were corrupted.<br>
  (Bug#39949: http://bugs.mysql.com/39949)<br>
<br>
* The 'Threads_created' status variable was not correctly<br>
  incremented when the server was started with the<br>
  '--thread-handling=pool-of-threads' option.<br>
  (Bug#39916: http://bugs.mysql.com/39916)<br>
<br>
* On Windows Vista, RESTORE did not correctly calculate the<br>
  validity point from the backup stream.<br>
  (Bug#39825: http://bugs.mysql.com/39825)<br>
<br>
* The MySQL Backup 'backup_history' log now contains a<br>
  'backup_file_path' column. 'backup_file' contains the basename and<br>
  backup_file_path contains the directory of the image file<br>
  pathname. (Bug#39690: http://bugs.mysql.com/39690)<br>
<br>
* Some MySQL Backup-related memory-use warnings detected by<br>
  Valgrind were corrected.<br>
  (Bug#39598: http://bugs.mysql.com/39598)<br>
<br>
* CHECK TABLE ... FOR UPGRADE did not check for incompatible<br>
  collation changes made in MySQL 5.0.48.<br>
  (Bug#39585: http://bugs.mysql.com/39585)<br>
<br>
* For a TIMESTAMP column in an InnoDB table, testing the column<br>
  with multiple conditions in the WHERE clause caused a server<br>
  crash. (Bug#39353: http://bugs.mysql.com/39353)<br>
<br>
* For BACKUP DATABASE, the server could add a / character to the<br>
  end of the backup path, even when the path ended with a<br>
  filename rather than a directory name.<br>
  (Bug#39189: http://bugs.mysql.com/39189)<br>
<br>
* The server could crash when attempting to insert duplicate<br>
  empty strings into a utf8 SET column.<br>
  (Bug#39186: http://bugs.mysql.com/39186)<br>
<br>
* References to local variables in stored procedures are<br>
  replaced with NAME_CONST(name, value) when written to the<br>
  binary log. However, an "illegal mix of collation" error might<br>
  occur when executing the log contents if the value's collation<br>
  differed from that of the variable. Now information about the<br>
  variable collation is written as well.<br>
  (Bug#39182: http://bugs.mysql.com/39182)<br>
<br>
* BACKUP DATABASE failed on PowerMac platforms due to type<br>
  casting problems. (Bug#39127: http://bugs.mysql.com/39127)<br>
<br>
* MySQL Backup was not handling several errors.<br>
  (Bug#39089: http://bugs.mysql.com/39089)<br>
<br>
* Some warnings were being reported as errors.<br>
  (Bug#39059: http://bugs.mysql.com/39059)<br>
<br>
* Queries of the form SELECT ... REGEXP BINARY NULL could lead<br>
  to a hung or crashed server.<br>
  (Bug#39021: http://bugs.mysql.com/39021)<br>
<br>
* Statements of the form INSERT ... SELECT .. ON DUPLICATE KEY<br>
  UPDATE col_name = DEFAULT could result in a server crash.<br>
  (Bug#39002: http://bugs.mysql.com/39002)<br>
<br>
* Repeated CREATE TABLE ... SELECT statements, where the created<br>
  table contained an AUTO_INCREMENT column, could lead to an<br>
  assertion failure. (Bug#38821: http://bugs.mysql.com/38821)<br>
<br>
* RESTORE crashed if a trigger and an event had the same name.<br>
  (Bug#38810: http://bugs.mysql.com/38810)<br>
<br>
* For deadlock between two transactions that required a timeout<br>
  to resolve, all server tables became inaccessible for the<br>
  duration of the deadlock.<br>
  (Bug#38804: http://bugs.mysql.com/38804)<br>
<br>
* When inserting a string into a duplicate-key error message,<br>
  the server could improperly interpret the string, resulting in<br>
  a crash. (Bug#38701: http://bugs.mysql.com/38701)<br>
<br>
* A race condition between threads sometimes caused unallocated<br>
  memory to be addressed.<br>
  (Bug#38692: http://bugs.mysql.com/38692)<br>
<br>
* A server crash resulted from concurrent execution of a<br>
  multiple-table UPDATE that used a NATURAL or USING join<br>
  together with FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK or ALTER TABLE for<br>
  the table being updated.<br>
  (Bug#38691: http://bugs.mysql.com/38691)<br>
<br>
* On ActiveState Perl, "mysql-test-run.pl" '--start-and-exit'<br>
  started but did not exit.<br>
  (Bug#38629: http://bugs.mysql.com/38629)<br>
<br>
* A server crash resulted from execution of an UPDATE that used<br>
  a derived table together with FLUSH TABLES.<br>
  (Bug#38499: http://bugs.mysql.com/38499)<br>
<br>
* Stored procedures involving substrings could crash the server<br>
  on certain platforms due to invalid memory reads.<br>
  (Bug#38469: http://bugs.mysql.com/38469)<br>
<br>
* The binary log filename stored in the 'binlog_file' column of<br>
  the 'mysql.backup_history' MySQL Backup table now is the file<br>
  basename (the final component). Previously, the full pathname<br>
  was stored, but this could be too long for the column width.<br>
  (Bug#38462: http://bugs.mysql.com/38462)<br>
<br>
* Queries containing a subquery with DISTINCT and ORDER BY could<br>
  cause a server crash. (Bug#38191: http://bugs.mysql.com/38191)<br>
<br>
* Errors during server startup caused destruction of an<br>
  uninitialized mutex and assertion failure.<br>
  (Bug#37961: http://bugs.mysql.com/37961)<br>
<br>
* The handlerton-to-plugin mapping implementation did not free<br>
  handler plugin references when the plugin was uninstalled,<br>
  resulting in a server crash after several install/uninstall<br>
  cycles. Also, on Mac OS X, the server crashed when trying to<br>
  access an EXAMPLE table after the EXAMPLE plugin was<br>
  installed. (Bug#37958: http://bugs.mysql.com/37958)<br>
<br>
* The server crashed if an argument to a stored procedure was a<br>
  subquery that returned more than one row.<br>
  (Bug#37949: http://bugs.mysql.com/37949)<br>
<br>
* When analyzing the possible index use cases, the server was<br>
  incorrectly reusing an internal structure, leading to a server<br>
  crash. (Bug#37943: http://bugs.mysql.com/37943)<br>
<br>
* Access checks were skipped for SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS and SHOW<br>
  FUNCTION STATUS, which could lead to a server crash or<br>
  insufficient access checks in subsequent statements.<br>
  (Bug#37908: http://bugs.mysql.com/37908)<br>
<br>
* Comparisons could hang for SET or ENUM columns that used<br>
  'latin2_czech_cs' collation.<br>
  (Bug#37854: http://bugs.mysql.com/37854)<br>
<br>
* SHOW PROCESSLIST displayed "copy to tmp table" when no such<br>
  copy was occurring. (Bug#37550: http://bugs.mysql.com/37550)<br>
<br>
* The <=> operator could return incorrect results when comparing<br>
  NULL to DATE, TIME, or DATETIME values.<br>
  (Bug#37526: http://bugs.mysql.com/37526)<br>
<br>
* MySQL Backup was not consistently checking for BSTREAM_ERROR<br>
  errors. (Bug#37522: http://bugs.mysql.com/37522)<br>
<br>
* The combination of a subquery with a GROUP BY, an aggregate<br>
  function calculated outside the subquery, and a GROUP BY on<br>
  the outer SELECT could cause the server to crash.<br>
  (Bug#37348: http://bugs.mysql.com/37348)<br>
<br>
* Incorrect BLOB handling by RESTORE could result in a server<br>
  crash. (Bug#37212: http://bugs.mysql.com/37212)<br>
<br>
* The NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES SQL mode was ignored for LOAD DATA<br>
  INFILE and SELECT INTO ... OUTFILE. The setting is taken into<br>
  account now. (Bug#37114: http://bugs.mysql.com/37114)<br>
<br>
* If thread-pooling was used and a connection attempt was denied<br>
  on the grounds of exceeding the user limits, the number of<br>
  active connections for that user was erroneously decreased<br>
  twice. The difference between the actual number connections<br>
  and the internal count could then cause debug builds of the<br>
  server to raise an assertion.<br>
  (Bug#36970: http://bugs.mysql.com/36970)<br>
<br>
* Long error messages for RESTORE could be truncated.<br>
  (Bug#36854: http://bugs.mysql.com/36854)<br>
<br>
* In some cases, references to views were confused with<br>
  references to anonymous tables and privilege checking was not<br>
  performed. (Bug#36086: http://bugs.mysql.com/36086)<br>
<br>
* For crash reports on Windows, symbol names in stack traces<br>
  were not correctly resolved.<br>
  (Bug#35987: http://bugs.mysql.com/35987)<br>
<br>
* ALTER EVENT changed the PRESERVE attribute of an event even<br>
  when PRESERVE was not specified in the statement.<br>
  (Bug#35981: http://bugs.mysql.com/35981)<br>
<br>
* Hostname values in SQL statements were not being checked for<br>
  '@', which is illegal according to RFC952.<br>
  (Bug#35924: http://bugs.mysql.com/35924)<br>
<br>
* "mysql_install_db" failed on machines that had the hostname set<br>
  to "localhost". (Bug#35754: http://bugs.mysql.com/35754)<br>
<br>
* Dynamic plugins failed to load on i5/OS.<br>
  (Bug#35743: http://bugs.mysql.com/35743)<br>
<br>
* With the PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH SQL mode enabled, a ucs2 CHAR<br>
  column returned additional garbage after trailing space<br>
  characters. (Bug#35720: http://bugs.mysql.com/35720)<br>
<br>
* RESTORE did not set the 'validity_point_time', 'binlog_pos', and<br>
  'binlog_file' fields of the 'backup_history' log table row.<br>
  (Bug#35240: http://bugs.mysql.com/35240)<br>
<br>
* With binary logging enabled, CREATE TABLE ... SELECT failed if<br>
  the source table was a log table.<br>
  (Bug#34306: http://bugs.mysql.com/34306)<br>
<br>
* If BACKUP DATABASE and RESTORE were done in a session with<br>
  autocommit disabled, a later DROP TABLE or RESTORE in the same<br>
  session failed. (Bug#34204: http://bugs.mysql.com/34204)<br>
<br>
* The 'secure_file_priv' system variable now applies to BACKUP<br>
  DATABASE and RESTORE operations: If the value is nonempty,<br>
  backup and restore operations can read and write files only in<br>
  the given directory. (Bug#34171: http://bugs.mysql.com/34171)<br>
<br>
* mysql_real_connect() did not check whether the MYSQL<br>
  connection handler was already connected and connected again<br>
  even if so. Now an CR_ALREADY_CONNECTED error occurs.<br>
  (Bug#33831: http://bugs.mysql.com/33831)<br>
<br>
* Shutting down the MySQL Server immediately following the<br>
  execution of a BACKUP DATABASE statement caused the server to<br>
  crash if the database to be backed up contained any Falcon<br>
  tables. (Bug#33575: http://bugs.mysql.com/33575)<br>
<br>
* The server crashed for BACKUP DATABASE if the backup progress<br>
  tables in the mysql database were missing or created<br>
  incorrectly. (Bug#33352: http://bugs.mysql.com/33352)<br>
<br>
* CHECKSUM TABLE was not killable with KILL QUERY.<br>
  (Bug#33146: http://bugs.mysql.com/33146)<br>
<br>
* A trigger for an InnoDB table activating multiple times could<br>
  lead to AUTO_INCREMENT gaps.<br>
  (Bug#31612: http://bugs.mysql.com/31612)<br>
<br>
* mysqldump could fail to dump views containing a large number<br>
  of columns. (Bug#31434: http://bugs.mysql.com/31434)<br>
<br>
* The server could improperly type user-defined variables used<br>
  in the select list of a query.<br>
  (Bug#26020: http://bugs.mysql.com/26020)<br>
<br>
* For access to the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS table, the server<br>
  did not check the SHOW VIEW and SELECT provileges, leading to<br>
  inconsistency between output from that table and the SHOW<br>
  CREATE VIEW statement.<br>
  (Bug#22763: http://bugs.mysql.com/22763)<br>
<br>
* "mysqld_safe" would sometimes fail to remove the pid file for<br>
  the old mysql process after a crash. As a result, the server<br>
  would fail to start due to a false A mysqld process already<br>
  exists... error. (Bug#11122: http://bugs.mysql.com/11122)<br>
