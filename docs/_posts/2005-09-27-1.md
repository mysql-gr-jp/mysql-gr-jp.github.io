MySQL 5.0 系列の最新バージョン、 5.0.13 がリリースされました。<br>
<br>
5.0.12 までは beta バージョンでしたが、この MySQL 5.0.13 からは rc 版（リリース候補版）となります。<br>
rc 版は、従来の MySQL バージョン （4.1, 4.0, 3.23 etc) では gamma リリース と呼ばれていたものです。<br>
<br>
　MySQL AB が 「疑いなく、 MySQL ５.０ は MySQL AB の今までに最も意欲的なリリースです。」 と説明するように、今までの MySQL とは大きく変わったことを実感できると思います。 その 「バージョン 5.0」 が　ついに rc 版となったのですから、わくわくしますね。<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
以下 チェンジログ：<br>
------------------------------<br>
■機能の追加と変更(5.0.13-rc)<br>
<br>
- Better detection of connection timeout for replication servers on Windows allows elimination of extraneous Lost connection errors in the error log. (Bug #5588 (http://bugs.mysql.com/5588))<br>
<br>
- The counters for the Key_read_requests, Key_reads, Key_write_requests, and Key_writes status variables were changed from unsigned long to unsigned longlong to accommodate larger variables without rollover. (Bug #12920 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12920))<br>
<br>
- The restriction on the use of PREPARE, EXECUTE, and DEALLOCATE PREPARE within stored procedures was lifted. The restriction still applies to stored functions and triggers. (Bug #10975 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10975), Bug #7115 (http://bugs.mysql.com/7115), Bug #10605 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10605))<br>
<br>
- A new command line argument was added to mysqld to ignore client character set information sent during handshake, and use server side settings instead, to reproduce 4.0 behaviour (Bug #9948 (http://bugs.mysql.com/9948)): mysqld --skip-character-set-client-handshake<br>
<br>
- OPTIMIZE TABLE and HANDLER now are prohibited in stored procedures and functions and in triggers. (Bug #12953 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12953), Bug #12995 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12995))<br>
<br>
- InnoDB: The TRUNCATE TABLE statement for InnoDB tables always resets the counter for an AUTO_INCREMENT column now, regardless of whether there is a foreign key constraint on the table. (Beginning with 5.0.3, TRUNCATE TABLE reset the counter, but only if there was no such constraint.) (Bug #11946 (http://bugs.mysql.com/11946))<br>
<br>
- The LEAST() and GREATEST() functions used to return NULL only if all arguments were NULL. Now they return NULL if any argument is NULL, the same as Oracle. (Bug #12791 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12791))<br>
<br>
- Two new collations have been added for Esperanto: utf8_esperanto_ci and ucs2_esperanto_ci.<br>
<br>
- Reorder network startup to come after all other initialization, particularly storage engine startup which can take a long time. This also prevents MySQL from being run on a privileged port (any port under 1024) unless run as the root user. (Bug #11707 (http://bugs.mysql.com/11707))<br>
<br>
- The Windows binary packages are now compiled with the Microsoft Visual Studio 2003 compiler instead of Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0<br>
<br>
- The binaries compiled with the Intel icc compiler are now built using icc 9.0 instead of icc 8.1. You will have to install new versions of the Intel icc runtime libraries, which are available from here: (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/os-linux.html)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
■バグ修正(5.0.13-rc)<br>
<br>
- Within a stored procedure, fetching a large number of rows in a loop using a cursor could result in a server crash or an out of memory error. Also, values inserted within a stored procedure using a cursor were interpreted as latin1 even if character set variables had been set to a different character set. (Bug #6513 (http://bugs.mysql.com/6513), Bug #9819 (http://bugs.mysql.com/9819))<br>
<br>
- For a server compiled with yaSSL, clients that used MySQL Connector/J were not able to establish SSH connections. (Bug #13029 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13029))<br>
<br>
- When used in view definitions, DAYNAME(expr), DAYOFWEEK(expr), WEEKDAY(expr) were incorrectly treated as though the expression was TO_DAYS(expr) or TO_DAYS(TO_DAYS(expr)). (Bug #13000 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13000))<br>
<br>
- Incorrect implicit nesting of joins caused the parser to fail on queries of the form SELECT ... FROM t1 JOIN t2 JOIN t3 ON t1.t1col = t3.t3col with an Unknown column 't1.t1col' in 'on clause' error. (Bug #12943 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12943))<br>
<br>
- NDB: A cluster shutdown following the crash of a data node would fail to terminate the remaining node processes, even though ndb_mgm showed the shutdown request as having been completed. (Bug #10938 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10938), Bug #9996 (http://bugs.mysql.com/9996), Bug #11623 (http://bugs.mysql.com/11623))<br>
<br>
- A column that can be NULL was not handled properly for WITH ROLLUP in a subquery or view. (Bug #12885 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12885))<br>
<br>
- Within a transaction, the following statements now cause an implicit commit: CREATE FUNCTION, DROP FUNCTION, DROP PROCEDURE, ALTER FUNCTION, ALTER PROCEDURE, CREATE PROCEDURE. This corrects a problem where these statements followed by ROLLBACK might not be replicated properly. (Bug #12870 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12870))<br>
<br>
- Simultaneous execution of DML statements and CREATE TRIGGER or DROP TRIGGER statements on the same table could cause server crashes or errors. (Bug #12704 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12704))<br>
<br>
- If a stored function invoked from a SELECT failed with an error, it could cause the client connection to be dropped. Now such errors generate warnings instead so as not to interrupt the SELECT. (Bug #12379 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12379))<br>
<br>
- A concurrency problem for CREATE ... SELECT could cause a server crash. (Bug #12845 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12845))<br>
<br>
- The server incorrectly generated an Unknown table error message when for attempts to drop tables in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA database. Now it issues an Access denied message. (Bug #9846 (http://bugs.mysql.com/9846))<br>
<br>
- The server allowed privileges to be granted explicitly for the INFORMATION_SCHEMA database. Such privileges are always implicit and should not be grantable. (Bug #10734 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10734))<br>
<br>
- The server allowed TEMPORARY tables and stored procedures to be created in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA database. (Bug #9683 (http://bugs.mysql.com/9683), Bug #10708 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10708))<br>
<br>
- The server failed to disallow SET AUTOCOMMIT in stored functions and triggers. It is allowed to change the value of AUTOCOMMIT in stored procedures, but a runtime error might occur if the procedure is invoked from a stored function or trigger. (Bug #12712 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12712))<br>
<br>
- Using an INOUT parameter with a DECIMAL data type in a stored procedure caused a server crash. (Bug #12979 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12979))<br>
<br>
- Performing an IS NULL check on the MIN() or MAX() of an indexed columns produced incorrect results. (Bug #12695 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12695))<br>
<br>
- The mysql.server script contained incorrect path for the libexec directory. (Bug #12550 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12550))<br>
<br>
- The NDB START BACKUP command could be interrupted by a SHOW command. (Bug #13054 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13054))<br>
<br>
- The LIKE ... ESCAPE syntax produced invalid results when escape character was larger than one byte. (Bug #12611 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12611))<br>
<br>
- A client connection thread cleanup problem caused the server to crash when closing the connection if the binary log was enabled. (Bug #12517 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12517))<br>
<br>
- Using AS to rename a column selected from a view in a subquery made it not possible to refer to that column in the outer query. (Bug #12993 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12993))<br>
<br>
- The character_set_system system variable could not be selected with SELECT @@character_set_system. (Bug #11775 (http://bugs.mysql.com/11775))<br>
<br>
- A view-creation statement of the form CREATE VIEW name AS SELECT ... FROM tbl_name AS name failed with a Not unique table/alias: 'name' error. (Bug #6808 (http://bugs.mysql.com/6808))<br>
<br>
- UNION [DISTINCT] was not removing all duplicates for multi-byte character values. (Bug #12891 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12891))<br>
<br>
- Multiplying a DECIMAL value within a loop in a stored routine could incorrectly result in a value of NULL. (Bug #12938 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12938))<br>
<br>
- mysql and mysqldump were ignoring the --defaults-extra-file option. (Bug #12917 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12917))<br>
<br>
- Columns named in the USING() clause of JOIN ... USING() were incorrectly resolved in case-sensitive fashion. (Bug #13067 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13067))<br>
<br>
- Local variables in stored routines were not always initialized correctly. (Bug #13133 (http://bugs.mysql.com/13133))<br>
<br>
- SHOW FIELDS FROM schemaname.viewname caused error 1046 when no default schema was set. (Bug #12905 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12905))<br>
<br>
- The value of character_set_results could be set to NULL, but returned the string "NULL" when retrieved. (Bug #12363 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12363))<br>
<br>
- InnoDB: Limit recursion depth to 200 in deadlock detection to avoid running out of stack space. (Bug #12588 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12588))<br>
<br>
- GROUP_CONCAT() ignored an empty string if it was the first value to occur in the result. (Bug #12863 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12863))<br>
<br>
- Outer join elimination was erroneously applied for some queries that used a NOT BETWEEN condition, an IN(value_list) condition, or an IF() condition. (Bug #12101 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12101), Bug #12102 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12102))<br>
<br>
- SHOW FIELDS truncated the TYPE column to 40 characters. (Bug #7142 (http://bugs.mysql.com/7142))<br>
<br>
- Use of PREPARE and EXECUTE with a statement that selected from a view in a subquery could cause a server crash. (Bug #12651 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12651))<br>
<br>
- On HP-UX 11.x (PA-RISC), the -L option caused mysqlimport to crash. (Bug #12958 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12958))<br>
<br>
- If the binary log is enabled, execution of a stored procedure that modifies table data and uses user variables could cause a server crash or incorrect information to be written to the binary log. (Bug #12637 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12637))<br>
<br>
- Queries with subqueries, where the inner subquery uses the range or index_merge access method, could return incorrect results. (Bug #12720 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12720))<br>
<br>
- After changing the character set with SET CHARACTER SET, the result of the GROUP_CONCAT() function was not converted to the proper character set. (Bug #12829 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12829))<br>
<br>
- A bug introduced in MySQL 5.0.12 caused SHOW TABLE STATUS to display an Auto_increment value of 0 for InnoDB tables. (Bug #12973 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12973))<br>
<br>
- Foreign keys were not properly enforced in TEMPORARY tables. Foreign keys now are disallowed in TEMPORARY tables. (Bug #12084 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12084))<br>
<br>
- Replication of LOAD DATA INFILE failed between systems that use different pathname syntax (such as delimiter characters). (Bug #11815 (http://bugs.mysql.com/11815))<br>
<br>
- Within a stored procedure, a server crash was caused by assigning to a VARCHAR INOUT parameter the value of an expression that included the variable itself. (For example, SET c = c.) (Bug #12849 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12849))<br>
<br>
- SELECT ... JOIN ... ON ... JOIN ... USING caused a server crash. (Bug #12977 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12977))<br>
<br>
- Using GROUP BY when selecting from a view in some cases could cause incorrect results to be returned. (Bug #12922 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12922))<br>
<br>
- A lock wait timeout caused InnoDB to roll back the entire current transaction. Now it rolls back only the most recent SQL statement. (Bug #12308 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12308))<br>
<br>
- myisampack did not properly pack BLOB values larger than 2^24 bytes. (Bug #4214 (http://bugs.mysql.com/4214))<br>
<br>
- Incorrect results could be returned from a view processed using a temporary table. (Bug #12941 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12941))<br>
<br>
- The server crashed when one thread resized the query cache while another thread was using it. (Bug #12848 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12848))<br>
<br>
- mysqld_multi now quotes arguments on command lines that it constructs to avoid problems with arguments that contain shell metacharacters. (Bug #11280 (http://bugs.mysql.com/11280))<br>
<br>
- InnoDB: A consistent read could return inconsistent results due to a bug introduced in MySQL 5.0.5. (Bug #12947 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12947))<br>
<br>
- Deadlock occurred when several account management statements were run (particularly between FLUSH PRIVILEGES/SET PASSWORD and GRANT/REVOKE statements). (Bug #12423 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12423))<br>
<br>
- The Windows installer made a change to one of the mysql.proc table files, causing stored routine functionality to be compromised. The Windows installer now never overwrites files in the MySQL data directory. During an upgrade from one version to another, a file in the data directory will not be overwritten even if it has not been modified since it was put there by an older installer. If you have already lost access to stored routines because of this problem, you can get them back using the following procedure:<br>
 + Stop the server.<br>
 + In the mysql\data directory under your MySQL installation directory, and replace the proc.frm file with corresponding file from the version of MySQL that you were using before you upgraded.<br>
 + Start the server<br>
 + Start the mysql command-line client (use the root account or another account that has full database privileges) and execute the mysql_fix_privilege_tables.sql script that upgrades the grant tables to the current structure. Instructions for doing this are given in Section 2.10.8, "Upgrading the Grant Tables." After this, all stored routine functionality should work. (Bug #12820 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12820))<br>
<br>
- On Windows, the server was preventing tables from being created if the table name was a prefix of a forbidden name. For example, nul is a forbidden name because it's the same as a Windows device name, but a table with the name of n or nu was being forbidden as well. (Bug #12325 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12325))<br>
<br>
- InnoDB was too permissive with LOCK TABLE ... READ LOCAL and alowed new inserts into the table. Now READ LOCAL is equivalent to READ for InnoDB. This will cause slightly more locking in mysqldump, but makes InnoDB table dumps consistent with MyISAM table dumps. (Bug #12410 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12410))<br>
<br>
- Use of the mysql client HELP command from within a stored routine caused a “packets out of order” error and a lost connection. Now HELP is detected and disallowed within stored routines. (Bug #12490 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12490))<br>
<br>
- Use of yaSSL for a secure client connection caused LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE to fail. (Bug #11286 (http://bugs.mysql.com/11286))<br>
<br>
- SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE and SHOW CREATE FUNCTION no longer qualify the routine name with the database name, for consistency with the behavior of SHOW CREATE TABLE. (Bug #10362 (http://bugs.mysql.com/10362))<br>
<br>
- A UNION of long utf8 VARCHAR columns was sometimes returned as a column with a LONGTEXT data type rather than VARCHAR. This could prevent such queries from working at all if selected into a MEMORY table because the MEMORY storage engine does not support the TEXT data types. (Bug #12537 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12537))<br>
<br>
- If a client has opened an InnoDB table for which the .ibd file is missing, InnoDB would not honor a DROP TABLE statement for the table. (Bug #12852 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12852))<br>
<br>
- ALTER TABLE ... DISCARD TABLESPACE for non-InnoDB table caused the client to lose the connection. (The server was not returning the error properly.) (Bug #12207 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12207))<br>
<br>
- DO IFNULL(NULL, NULL) and SELECT CAST(IFNULL(NULL, NULL) AS DECIMAL) caused a server crash. (Bug #12841 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12841))<br>
<br>
- When using a cursor, a SELECT statement that uses a GROUP BY clause could return incorrect results. (Bug #11904 (http://bugs.mysql.com/11904))<br>
<br>
- The SYSDATE() function now returns the time at which it was invoked. In particular, within a stored routine or trigger, SYSDATE() returns the time at which it executes, not the time at which the stored routine or triggering statement began to execute. (Bug #12480 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12480))<br>
<br>
- CREATE VIEW inside a stored procedure caused a server crash if the table underlying the view had been deleted. (Bug #12468 (http://bugs.mysql.com/12468))<br>
<br>
- A memory leak resulting from repeated SELECT ... INTO statements inside a stored procedure could cause the server to crash. (Bug #11333 (http://bugs.mysql.com/11333))<br>
<br>
<br>
