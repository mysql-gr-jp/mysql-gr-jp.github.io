以下、チェンジログ(5.1.47)：<br>
<br>
■InnoDB Plugin について：<br>
  * InnoDB Plugin has been upgraded to version 1.0.8. This version<br>
    is considered of General Availability (GA) quality. InnoDB<br>
    Plugin Change History<br>
    (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/innodb-plugin/1.0/en/innodb-changes.<br>
    html), may contain information in addition to those changes<br>
    reported here.<br>
    In this release, the InnoDB Plugin is included in source and<br>
    binary distributions, except RHEL3, RHEL4, SuSE 9 (x86,<br>
    x86_64, ia64), and generic Linux RPM packages. It also does<br>
    not work for FreeBSD 6 and HP-UX or for Linux on generic ia64.<br>
<br>
<br>
■機能の追加と変更：<br>
  * InnoDB stores redo log records in a hash table during<br>
    recovery. On 64-bit systems, this hash table was 1/8 of the<br>
    buffer pool size. To reduce memory usage, the dimension of the<br>
    hash table was reduced to 1/64 of the buffer pool size (or<br>
    1/128 on 32-bit systems).<br>
    (Bug#53122: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=53122)<br>
<br>
<br>
■バグ修正：<br>
  * Security Fix: The server failed to check the table name<br>
    argument of a COM_FIELD_LIST command packet for validity and<br>
    compliance to acceptable table name standards. This could be<br>
    exploited to bypass almost all forms of checks for privileges<br>
    and table-level grants by providing a specially crafted table<br>
    name argument to COM_FIELD_LIST.<br>
    In MySQL 5.0 and above, this allowed an authenticated user<br>
    with SELECT privileges on one table to obtain the field<br>
    definitions of any table in all other databases and<br>
    potentially of other MySQL instances accessible from the<br>
    server's file system.<br>
    Additionally, for MySQL version 5.1 and above, an<br>
    authenticated user with DELETE or SELECT privileges on one<br>
    table could delete or read content from any other table in all<br>
    databases on this server, and potentially of other MySQL<br>
    instances accessible from the server's file system.<br>
    (Bug#53371: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=53371,<br>
    CVE-2010-1848<br>
    (http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1848))<br>
<br>
  * Security Fix: The server was susceptible to a buffer-overflow<br>
    attack due to a failure to perform bounds checking on the<br>
    table name argument of a COM_FIELD_LIST command packet. By<br>
    sending long data for the table name, a buffer is overflown,<br>
    which could be exploited by an authenticated user to inject<br>
    malicious code.<br>
    (Bug#53237: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=53237,<br>
    CVE-2010-1850<br>
    (http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1850))<br>
<br>
  * Security Fix: The server could be tricked into reading packets<br>
    indefinitely if it received a packet larger than the maximum<br>
    size of one packet.<br>
    (Bug#50974: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50974,<br>
    CVE-2010-1849<br>
    (http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1849))<br>
<br>
  * Important Change: Replication: When invoked, CHANGE MASTER TO<br>
    and SET GLOBAL sql_slave_skip_counter now cause information to<br>
    be written to the error log about the slave's state prior to<br>
    execution of the statement. For CHANGE MASTER TO, this<br>
    information includes the previous values for MASTER_HOST,<br>
    MASTER_PORT, MASTER_LOG_FILE, and MASTER_LOG_POS. For SET<br>
    GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER, this information includes the<br>
    previous values of sql_slave_skip_counter, the group relay log<br>
    name, and the group relay log position.<br>
    (Bug#43406: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=43406,<br>
    Bug#43407: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=43407)<br>
<br>
  * Replication: The failure of a REVOKE statement was logged with<br>
    the wrong error code, causing replication slaves to stop even<br>
    when the failure was expected on the master.<br>
    (Bug#51987: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=51987)<br>
<br>
  * Certain path names passed to LOAD_FILE() could cause a server<br>
    crash. (Bug#53417: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=53417)<br>
<br>
  * When reporting a foreign key constraint violation during<br>
    INSERT, InnoDB could display uninitialized data for the<br>
    DB_TRX_ID and DB_ROLL_PTR system columns.<br>
    (Bug#53202: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=53202)<br>
<br>
  * InnoDB page splitting could enter an infinite loop for<br>
    compressed tables.<br>
    (Bug#52964: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=52964)<br>
<br>
  * An overly strict assertion could fail during the purge of<br>
    delete-marked records in DYNAMIC or COMPRESSED InnoDB tables<br>
    that contain column prefix indexes.<br>
    (Bug#52746: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=52746)<br>
<br>
  * InnoDB attempted to choose off-page storage without ensuring<br>
    that there was an "off-page storage" flag in the record<br>
    header. To correct this, in DYNAMIC and COMPRESSED formats,<br>
    InnoDB stores locally any non-BLOB columns having a maximum<br>
    length not exceeding 256 bytes. This is because there is no<br>
    room for the "external storage" flag when the maximum length<br>
    is 255 bytes or less. This restriction trivially holds in<br>
    REDUNDANT and COMPACT formats, because there InnoDB always<br>
    stores locally columns having a length up to local_len = 788<br>
    bytes. (Bug#52745: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=52745)<br>
<br>
  * Semi-consistent read was implemented for InnoDB to address<br>
    Bug#3300: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=3300.<br>
    Semi-consistent reads do not block when a nonmatching record<br>
    is already locked by some other transaction. If the record is<br>
    not locked, a lock is acquired, but is released if the record<br>
    does not match the WHERE condition. However, semi-consistent<br>
    read was attempted even for UPDATE statements having a WHERE<br>
    condition of the form pk_col1=constant1, ...,<br>
    pk_colN=constantN. Some code that was designed with the<br>
    assumption that semi-consistent read would be only attempted<br>
    on table scans, failed.<br>
    (Bug#52663: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=52663)<br>
<br>
  * Setting @@GLOBAL.debug to an empty string failed to clear the<br>
    current debug settings.<br>
    (Bug#52629: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=52629)<br>
<br>
  * A memory leak occurred due to missing deallocation of the<br>
    comparators array (a member of the Arg_comparator class).<br>
    (Bug#52124: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=52124)<br>
<br>
  * For debug builds, creating a view containing a subquery that<br>
    might require collation adjustment caused an assertion to be<br>
    raised. For example, this could occur if some items had<br>
    different collations but the result collation could be<br>
    adjusted to the one of them.<br>
    (Bug#52120: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=52120)<br>
<br>
  * Connections waiting for an InnoDB row lock ignored KILL until<br>
    the row lock wait ended. Now, KILL during lock wait results in<br>
    "query interrupted" instead of "lock wait timeout exceeded".<br>
    (Bug#51920: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=51920)<br>
<br>
  * Locking involving the LOCK_plugin,<br>
    LOCK_global_system_variables, and LOCK_status mutexes could<br>
    deadlock. (Bug#51591: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=51591)<br>
<br>
  * InnoDB fast index creation could incorrectly use a table copy<br>
    in some cases.<br>
    (Bug#50946: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50946)<br>
<br>
  * A syntactically invalid trigger could cause the server to<br>
    crash when trying to list triggers.<br>
    (Bug#50755: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50755)<br>
<br>
  * InnoDB Plugin checks to see whether a row could possibly<br>
    exceed the maximum size if all columns are fully used. This<br>
    produced Row size too large errors for some tables that could<br>
    be created with the built-in InnoDB. Now the check is only<br>
    done when innodb_strict_mode is enabled or if the table is<br>
    dynamic or compressed.<br>
    (Bug#50495: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=50495)<br>
<br>
  * In MySQL 5.1, READ COMMITTED was changed to use less locking<br>
    due to the availability of row based binary logging (see the<br>
    Note under READ COMMITTED at Section 12.3.6, "SET TRANSACTION<br>
    Syntax"). However, READ UNCOMMITTED did not have the same<br>
    change, so it was using more locks than the higher isolation<br>
    level, which is unexpected. This was changed so that READ<br>
    UNCOMMITTED now also uses the lesser amount of locking and has<br>
    the same restrictions for binary logging.<br>
    (Bug#48607: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48607)<br>
<br>
  * EXPLAIN could cause a server crash for some queries with<br>
    subqueries.<br>
    (Bug#48419: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48419)<br>
<br>
  * On Windows, the server failed to find a description for Event<br>
    ID 100. (Bug#48042: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48042)<br>
<br>
  * For updates to InnoDB tables, TIMESTAMP columns could be<br>
    updated even when no values actually changed.<br>
    (Bug#47453: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47453)<br>
<br>
  * If the server is started with --skip-grant-tables, plugin<br>
    loading and unloading should be disallowed, but the server<br>
    failed to reject INSTALL PLUGIN and UNINSTALL PLUGIN<br>
    statements.<br>
    (Bug#46261: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=46261)<br>
<br>
  * Storage engine plugins on Windows could've been built with a<br>
    definition of time_t which was different from the server<br>
    expectations. The difference could cause affected plugins to<br>
    crash. In addition, the use of the time_t type in the storage<br>
    engine API layer has been enforced.<br>
    (Bug#39802: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=39802,<br>
    Bug#40092: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=40092)<br>
<br>
  * When using UNINSTALL PLUGIN to remove a loaded plugin, open<br>
    tables and connections caused mysqld to hang until the open<br>
    connections had been closed.<br>
    (Bug#39053: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=39053)<br>
<br>
  * 1) In rare cases, if a thread was interrupted during a FLUSH<br>
    PRIVILEGES operation, a debug assertion occurred later due to<br>
    improper diagnostic area setup. 2) A KILL operation could<br>
    cause a console error message referring to a diagnostic area<br>
    state without first ensuring that the state existed.<br>
