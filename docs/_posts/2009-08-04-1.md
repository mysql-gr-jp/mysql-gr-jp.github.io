■機能の追加と変更(5.1.37)：<br>
- Important Change: Replication: RESET MASTER and RESET SLAVE<br>
  now reset the values shown for Last_IO_Error, Last_IO_Errno,<br>
  Last_SQL_Error, and Last_SQL_Errno in the output of SHOW SLAVE<br>
  STATUS. (Bug#44270: http://bugs.mysql.com/44270)<br>

■バグ修正(5.1.37)：<br>
- Security Fix: Partitioning: Accessing a table with user-defined<br>
  partitioning when the server SQL mode included ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY<br>
  caused the MySQL server to crash. For example, the following<br>
  sequence of statements crashed the server:<br>
<br>
  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1;<br>
<br>
  SET SESSION SQL_MODE='ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY';<br>
<br>
  CREATE TABLE t1(id INT, key(id))<br>
      PARTITION BY HASH(id) PARTITIONS 2;<br>
<br>
  (Bug#45807: http://bugs.mysql.com/45807)<br>
<br>
- Important Change: Replication: When using STATEMENT or MIXED<br>
  binary logging format, a statement that changes both<br>
  non-transactional and transactional tables must be written to<br>
  the binary log whenever there are changes to non-transactional<br>
  tables. This means that the statement goes into the binary log<br>
  even when the changes to the transactional tables fail. In<br>
  particular, in the event of a failure such statement is<br>
  annotated with the error number and wrapped inside a pair of<br>
  BEGIN and ROLLBACK statements.<br>
  On the slave, while applying the statement, it is expected<br>
  that the same failure and the rollback prevent the<br>
  transactional changes from persisting. However, statements<br>
  that fail due to concurrency issues such as deadlocks and<br>
  timeouts are logged in the same way, causing the slave to stop<br>
  since the statements are applied sequentially by the SQL<br>
  thread.<br>
  To address this issue, we ignore concurrency failures on the<br>
  slave. Specifically, the following failures are now ignored:<br>
  ER_LOCK_WAIT_TIMEOUT, ER_LOCK_DEADLOCK, and ER_XA_RBDEADLOCK.<br>
  (Bug#44581: http://bugs.mysql.com/44581)<br>
<br>
- Partitioning: Truncating a partitioned MyISAM table did not<br>
  reset the AUTO_INCREMENT value.<br>
  (Bug#35111: http://bugs.mysql.com/35111)<br>
<br>
- Replication: The SHOW SLAVE STATUS connection thread competed<br>
  with the slave SQL thread for use of the error message buffer.<br>
  As a result, the connection thread sometimes received<br>
  incomplete messages. This issue was uncovered with valgrind<br>
  when message strings were passed without NULL terminators,<br>
  causing the error Conditional jump or move depends on<br>
  uninitialised value(s).<br>
  (Bug#45511: http://bugs.mysql.com/45511)<br>
  See also Bug#43076: http://bugs.mysql.com/43076.<br>
<br>
- Replication: Large transactions and statements could corrupt<br>
  the binary log if the size of the cache (as set by<br>
  max_binlog_cache_size) was not large enough to store the<br>
  changes.<br>
  Now, for transactions that do not fit into the cache, the<br>
  statement is not logged, and the statement generates an error<br>
  instead.<br>
  For non-transactional changes that do not fit into the cache,<br>
  the statement is also not logged --- an incident event is<br>
  logged after committing or rolling back any pending<br>
  transaction, and the statement then raises an error.<br>
<br>
  Note<br>
  If a failure occurs before the incident event is written the<br>
  binary log, the slave does not stop, and the master does not<br>
  report any errors.<br>
  (Bug#43929: http://bugs.mysql.com/43929)<br>
  See also Bug#37148: http://bugs.mysql.com/37148.<br>
<br>
- Replication: The --database option for mysqlbinlog was ignored<br>
  when using the row-based logging format.<br>
  (Bug#42941: http://bugs.mysql.com/42941)<br>
<br>
- Replication: Shutting down the server while executing FLUSH<br>
  LOGS, CHANGE MASTER TO, or STOP SLAVE could sometimes cause<br>
  mysqld to crash. (Bug#38240: http://bugs.mysql.com/38240)<br>
<br>
- Replication: When reading a binary log that was in use by a<br>
  master or that had not been properly closed (possibly due to a<br>
  crash), the following message was printed: Warning: this<br>
  binlog was not closed properly. Most probably mysqld crashed<br>
  writing it. This message did not take into account the<br>
  possibility that the file was merely in use by the master,<br>
  which caused some users concern who were not aware that this<br>
  could happen.<br>
  To make this clear, the original message has been replaced<br>
  with Warning: this binlog is either is use or was not closed<br>
  properly. (Bug#34687: http://bugs.mysql.com/34687)<br>
<br>
- The server crashed if evaluation of GROUP_CONCAT(... ORDER BY)<br>
  required allocation of a sort buffer but allocation failed.<br>
  (Bug#46080: http://bugs.mysql.com/46080)<br>
<br>
- When creating tables using the IBMDB2I storage engine with the<br>
  ibmdb2i_create_index_option option set to 1, creating an<br>
  IBMDB2I table with a primary key should produce an additional<br>
  index that uses EBCDIC hexadecimal sorting, but this index was<br>
  not created. (Bug#45983: http://bugs.mysql.com/45983)<br>
<br>
- With InnoDB tables, MySQL used a less-selective secondary<br>
  index to avoid a filesort even if a prefix of the primary key<br>
  was much more selective.<br>
  The fix for this problem might cause other queries to run more<br>
  slowly. (Bug#45828: http://bugs.mysql.com/45828)<br>
<br>
- The server crashed for attempts to use REPLACE or INSERT ...<br>
  ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE with a view defined using a join.<br>
  (Bug#45806: http://bugs.mysql.com/45806)<br>
<br>
- Some collations were causing IBMDB2I to report inaccurate key<br>
  range estimations to the optimizer for LIKE clauses that<br>
  select substrings. This can be seen by running EXPLAIN. This<br>
  problem primarily affects multi-byte and unicode character<br>
  sets. (Bug#45803: http://bugs.mysql.com/45803)<br>
<br>
- Invalid memory reads and writes were generated when altering<br>
  merge and base tables. This could lead to a crash or Valgrind<br>
  errors:<br>
  ==28038== Invalid write of size 1<br>

  (Bug#45796: http://bugs.mysql.com/45796)<br>
<br>
- Inserting data into a table using the macce character set with<br>
  the IBMDB2I storage engine would fail.<br>
  (Bug#45793: http://bugs.mysql.com/45793)<br>
<br>
- There was a race condition when changing<br>
  innodb_commit_concurrency at runtime to the value DEFAULT.<br>
  (Bug#45749: http://bugs.mysql.com/45749)<br>
  See also Bug#42101: http://bugs.mysql.com/42101.<br>
<br>
- Performing an empty XA transaction caused the server to crash<br>
  for the next XA transaction.<br>
  (Bug#45548: http://bugs.mysql.com/45548)<br>
<br>
- For replication of a stored procedure that uses the gbk<br>
  character set, the result on the master and slave differed.<br>
  (Bug#45485: http://bugs.mysql.com/45485)<br>
<br>
- SHOW CREATE TRIGGER requires the TRIGGER privilege but was not<br>
  checking privileges. (Bug#45412: http://bugs.mysql.com/45412)<br>
<br>
- An assertion failure could occur if InnoDB tried to unlock a<br>
  record when the clustered index record was unknown.<br>
  (Bug#45357: http://bugs.mysql.com/45357)<br>
<br>
- Bug#19027: http://bugs.mysql.com/19027 caused<br>
  --enable-plugin_name (for example, --enable-innodb) not to<br>
  work. (Bug#45336: http://bugs.mysql.com/45336)<br>
<br>
- If autocommit was enabled, InnoDB did not roll back DELETE or<br>
  UPDATE statements if the statement was killed.<br>
  (Bug#45309: http://bugs.mysql.com/45309)<br>
<br>
- Use of DECIMAL constants with more than 65 digits in CREATE<br>
  TABLE ... SELECT statements led to spurious errors or<br>
  assertion failures. (Bug#45262: http://bugs.mysql.com/45262)<br>
<br>
- The mysql client could misinterpret some character sequences<br>
  as commands under some circumstances.<br>
  (Bug#45236: http://bugs.mysql.com/45236)<br>
<br>
- Use of CONVERT() with an empty SET value could cause an<br>
  assertion failure. (Bug#45168: http://bugs.mysql.com/45168)<br>
<br>
- InnoDB recovery could hang due to redo logging of doublewrite<br>
  buffer pages. (Bug#45097: http://bugs.mysql.com/45097)<br>
<br>
- when reading binary data, the concatenation function for<br>
  geometry data collections did not rigorously check for<br>
  available data, leading to invalid reads and server crashes.<br>
  (Bug#44684: http://bugs.mysql.com/44684)<br>
<br>
- If an error occurred during the creation of a table (for<br>
  example, the table already existed) having an AUTO_INCREMENT<br>
  column and a BEFORE trigger that used the INSERT ... SELECT<br>
  construct, an internal flag was not reset properly. This led<br>
  to a crash the next time that the table was opened again.<br>
  (Bug#44653: http://bugs.mysql.com/44653)<br>
<br>
- For queries with a sufficient number of subqueries in the FROM<br>
  clause of this form:<br>
  SELECT * FROM (SELECT 1) AS t1,<br>
                (SELECT 2) AS t2,<br>
                (SELECT 3) AS t3, ...<br>
  The query failed with a Too high level of nesting for select<br>
  error, as though the query had this form:<br>
  SELECT * FROM (SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT 2 FROM (SELECT 3 FROM ...<br>
  (Bug#44156: http://bugs.mysql.com/44156)<br>
<br>
- configure.in contained references to literal instances of nm<br>
  and libc, rather than to variables parameterized for the<br>
  proper values on the current platform.<br>
  (Bug#42721: http://bugs.mysql.com/42721)<br>
<br>
- configure.in did not properly check for the<br>
  pthread_setschedprio() function.<br>
  (Bug#42599: http://bugs.mysql.com/42599)<br>
<br>
- A workaround for a Sun Studio bug was instituted.<br>
  (Bug#41710: http://bugs.mysql.com/41710)<br>
<br>
- Valgrind warnings that occurred for SHOW TABLE STATUS with<br>
  InnoDB tables were silenced.<br>
  (Bug#38479: http://bugs.mysql.com/38479)<br>
<br>
- In the mysql client, if the server connection was lost during<br>
  repeated status commands, the client would fail to detect this<br>
  and command output would be inconsistent.<br>
  (Bug#37274: http://bugs.mysql.com/37274)<br>
<br>
- When invoked to start multiple server instances, mysqld_multi<br>
  sometimes would fail to start them all due to not changing<br>
  location into the base directory for each instance.<br>
  (Bug#36654: http://bugs.mysql.com/36654)<br>
<br>
- Renaming a column that appeared in a foreign key definition<br>
  did not update the foreign key definition with the new column<br>
  name. (Bug#21704: http://bugs.mysql.com/21704)<br>
