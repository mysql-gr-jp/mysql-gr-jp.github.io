MySQL 5.0. シリーズの最新バージョンである、MySQL 5.0.24 がリリースされました。<br>
<br>
バージョン 5.0.23はリリース直前に問題が発見されたためにリリースされませんでしたので、約２ヶ月ぶりの 5.0 シリーズのリリースということになります。<br>
<br>
大量のバグ修正や変更がなされています。<br>
詳細はチェンジログを参照ください。<br>
<br>
<br>
------<br>
以下チェンジログ：<br>
<br>
■バグ修正(5.0.24)：<br>
- Security fix: If a user has access to MyISAM table t, that user can create a MERGE table m that accesses t. However, if the user's privileges on t are subsequently revoked, the user can continue to access t by doing so through m. If this behavior is undesirable, you can start the server with the new --skip-merge option to disable the MERGE storage engine. (Bug#15195: http://bugs.mysql.com/15195)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: The repeated creating and dropping of a table would eventually lead to NDB Error 826, Too many tables and attributes ... Insufficient space. (Bug#20847: http://bugs.mysql.com/20847)<br>
<br>
- With the auto_increment_increment system variable set larger than 1, if the next generate AUTO_INCREMENT value would be larger than the column's maximum value, the value would be clipped down to that maximum value and inserted, even if the resulting value would not be in the generated sequence. This could cause problems for master-master replication. Now the server clips the value down to the previous value in the sequence, which correctly produces a duplicate-key error if that value already exists in the column. (Bug#20524: http://bugs.mysql.com/20524)<br>
<br>
- If a table on a slave server had a higher AUTO_INCREMENT counter than the corresponding master table (even though all rows of the two tables were identical), in some cases REPLACE or INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE would not replicate properly using statement-based logging. (Different values would be inserted on the master and slave.) (Bug#20188: http://bugs.mysql.com/20188)<br>
<br>
- Under heavy load (executing more than 1024 simultaneous complex queries), a problem in the code that handles internal temporary tables could lead to writing beyond allocated space and memory corruption. Use of more than 1024 simultaneous cursors server wide also could lead to memory corruption. (This applies both to stored procedure and C API cursors.) (Bug#21206: http://bugs.mysql.com/21206)<br>
<br>
- A race condition during slave server shutdown caused an assert failure. (Bug#20850: http://bugs.mysql.com/20850)<br>
<br>
- mysqldump produced a malformed dump file when dumping multiple databases that contained views. (Bug#20221: http://bugs.mysql.com/20221)<br>
<br>
- SELECT @@INSERT_ID displayed a value unrelated to a preceding SET INSERT_ID. (It was returning LAST_INSERT_ID instead.) (Bug#20392: http://bugs.mysql.com/20392)<br>
<br>
- Updating a column of a FEDERATED table to NULL sometimes failed. (Bug#16494: http://bugs.mysql.com/16494)<br>
<br>
- Performing INSERT ... SELECT ... JOIN ... USING without qualifying the column names caused ERROR 1052 "column 'x' in field list is ambiguous" even in cases where the column references were unambiguous. (Bug#18080: http://bugs.mysql.com/18080)<br>
<br>
- Bug#10952: http://bugs.mysql.com/10952 may cause inadvertent data loss. A fix for this bug had been contained in MySQL 5.0.23, but the approach used causes a loss of intended functionality. Because of this, that fix has been reverted in MySQL 5.0.24. As a consequence, the risk of inadvertent data loss still exists, see Bug#10952: http://bugs.mysql.com/10952<br>
<br>
- A SELECT that used a subquery in the FROM clause that did not select from a table failed when the subquery was used in a join. (Bug#21002: http://bugs.mysql.com/21002)<br>
<br>
- REPLACE ... SELECT for a view required the INSERT privilege for tables other than the table being modified. (Bug#21135: http://bugs.mysql.com/21135)<br>
<br>
- Failure to account for a NULL table pointer on big-endian machines could cause a server crash during type conversion. (Bug#21135: http://bugs.mysql.com/21135)<br>
<br>
- mysqldump sometimes did not select the correct database before trying to dump views from it, resulting in an empty result set that caused mysqldump to die with a segmentation fault. (Bug#21014: http://bugs.mysql.com/21014)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
■以下は5.0.23でのバグ修正(5.0.23はリリースされませんでした)<br>
<br>
■機能の追加と変更(5.0.23)：<br>
- NDB Cluster: The limit of 2048 ordered indexes per cluster has been lifted. There is now no upper limit on the number of ordered indexes (including AUTO_INCREMENT columns) that may be used. (Bug#14509: http://bugs.mysql.com/14509)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: The status variables Ndb_connected_host and Ndb_connected_port were renamed to Ndb_config_from_host and Ndb_config_from_port, respectively.<br>
<br>
- The mysql_upgrade command has been converted from a shell script to a C program, so it is available on non-Unix systems such as Windows. This program should be run for each MySQL upgrade. See Section 5.6.2, "mysql_upgrade --- Check Tables for MySQL Upgrade."<br>
<br>
- Binary distributions that include SSL support now are built using yaSSL when possible.<br>
<br>
- Added the --ssl-verify-server-cert option to MySQL client programs. This option causes the server's Common Name value in its certificate to be verified against the hostname used when connecting to the server, and the connection is rejected if there is a mismatch. Added MYSQL_OPT_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT option for the mysql_options() C API function to enable this verification. This feature can be used to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Verification is disabled by default. (Bug#17208: http://bugs.mysql.com/17208)<br>
<br>
- Added the ssl_ca, ssl_capath, ssl_cert, ssl_cipher, and ssl_key system variables, which display the values given via the corresponding command options. See Section 5.9.7.3, "SSL Command Options." (Bug#19606: http://bugs.mysql.com/19606)<br>
<br>
- Added the log_queries_not_using_indexes system variable. (Bug#19616: http://bugs.mysql.com/19616)<br>
<br>
- Added the --angel-pid-file option to mysqlmanager for specifying the file in which the angel process records its process ID when mysqlmanager runs in daemon mode. (Bug#14106: http://bugs.mysql.com/14106)<br>
<br>
- The ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY SQL mode now also applies to the HAVING clause. That is, columns not named in the GROUP BY clause cannot be used in the HAVING clause if not used in an aggregate function. (Bug#18739: http://bugs.mysql.com/18739)<br>
<br>
- SQL syntax for prepared statements now supports ANALYZE TABLE, OPTIMIZE TABLE, and REPAIR TABLE. (Bug#19308: http://bugs.mysql.com/19308)<br>
<br>
- The bundled yaSSL library was upgraded to version 1.3.5. This improves handling of certain problems with SSL-related command options. (Bug#17737: http://bugs.mysql.com/17737)<br>
<br>
- Added the --set-charset option to mysqlbinlog to allow the character set to be specified for processing binary log files. (Bug#18351: http://bugs.mysql.com/18351)<br>
<br>
- For a table with an AUTO_INCREMENT column, SHOW CREATE TABLE now shows the next AUTO_INCREMENT value to be generated. (Bug#19025: http://bugs.mysql.com/19025)<br>
<br>
- It is now possible to use NEW.var_name values within triggers as INOUT parameters to stored procedures. (Bug#14635: http://bugs.mysql.com/14635)<br>
<br>
- The mysqldumpslow script has been moved from client RPM packages to server RPM packages. This corrects a problem where mysqldumpslow could not be used with a client-only RPM install, because it depends on my_print_defaults which is in the server RPM. (Bug#20216: http://bugs.mysql.com/20216)<br>
<br>
<br>
■バグ修正(5.0.23)：<br>
<br>
- Re-executing a stored procedure with a complex stored procedure cursor query could lead to a server crash. (Bug#15217: http://bugs.mysql.com/15217)<br>
<br>
- Views created from prepared statements inside of stored procedures were created with a definition that included both SQL_CACHE and SQL_NO_CACHE. (Bug#17203: http://bugs.mysql.com/17203)<br>
<br>
- mysqldump did not dump the table name correctly for some table identifiers that contained unusual characters such as `:'. (Bug#19479: http://bugs.mysql.com/19479)<br>
<br>
- mysqldump would not dump views that had become invalid because a table named in the view definition had been dropped. Instead, it quit with an error message. Now you can specify the --force option to cause mysqldump to keep going and write a SQL comment containing the view definition to the dump output. (Bug#17371: http://bugs.mysql.com/17371)<br>
<br>
- The WITH CHECK OPTION was not enforced when a REPLACE statement was executed against a view. (Bug#19789: http://bugs.mysql.com/19789)<br>
<br>
- The use of MIN() and MAX() on columns with a partial index produced incorrect results in some queries. (Bug#18206: http://bugs.mysql.com/18206)<br>
<br>
- Concatenating the results of multiple constant subselects produced incorrect results. (Bug#16716: http://bugs.mysql.com/16716)<br>
<br>
- A "table not found" error could occur for statements that called a function defined in another database. (Bug#17199: http://bugs.mysql.com/17199)<br>
<br>
- A buffer overwrite error in Instance Manager caused a crash. (Bug#20622: http://bugs.mysql.com/20622)<br>
<br>
- Re-execution of a prepared multiple-table DELETE statement that involves a trigger or stored function can result in a server crash. (Bug#19634: http://bugs.mysql.com/19634)<br>
<br>
- On Windows, corrected a crash stemming from differences in Visual C runtime library routines from POSIX behavior regarding invalid file descriptors. (Bug#18275: http://bugs.mysql.com/18275)<br>
<br>
- Multiple-table updates with FEDERATED tables could cause a server crash. (Bug#19773: http://bugs.mysql.com/19773)<br>
<br>
- On Windows, terminating mysqld with Control-C could result in a crash during shutdown. (Bug#18235: http://bugs.mysql.com/18235)<br>
<br>
- On Windows, removal of binary log files would fail if the files were already open. (Bug#19208: http://bugs.mysql.com/19208)<br>
<br>
- mysqldump produced garbled output for view definitions. (Bug#18462: http://bugs.mysql.com/18462)<br>
<br>
- The omission of leading zeros in dates could lead to erroneous results when these were compared with the output of certain date and time functions. (Bug#16377: http://bugs.mysql.com/16377)<br>
<br>
- An invalid comparison between keys in partial indexes over multi-byte character fields could lead to incorrect result sets if the selected query execution plan used a range scan by a partial index over a UTF8 character field. This also caused incorrect results under similar circumstances with many other character sets. (Bug#14896: http://bugs.mysql.com/14896)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Cluster system status variables were not updated. (Bug#11459: http://bugs.mysql.com/11459)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: The cluster's data nodes would fail while trying to load data when NoOfFrangmentLogFiles was equal to 1. (Bug#19894: http://bugs.mysql.com/19894)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: A problem with error handling when ndb_use_exact_count was enabled could lead to incorrect values returned from queries using COUNT(). A warning is now returned in such cases. (Bug#19202: http://bugs.mysql.com/19202)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Restoring a backup made using ndb_restore failed when the backup had been taken from a cluster whose data memory was full. (Bug#19852: http://bugs.mysql.com/19852)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: TEXT columns in Cluster tables having both an explicit primary key and a unique key were not correctly updated by REPLACE statements. (Bug#19906: http://bugs.mysql.com/19906)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: An internal formatting error caused some management client error messages to be unreadable. (Bug#20016: http://bugs.mysql.com/20016)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Running management client commands while mgmd was in the process of disconnecting could cause the management server to fail. (Bug#19932: http://bugs.mysql.com/19932)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster (NDBAPI): Update operations on blobs were not checked for illegal operations. Note: Read locks with blob update operations are now upgraded from read committed to read shared.<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: The management client ALL STOP command shut down mgmd processes (as well as ndbd processes). (Bug#18966: http://bugs.mysql.com/18966)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: LOAD DATA LOCAL failed to ignore duplicate keys in Cluster tables. (Bug#19496: http://bugs.mysql.com/19496)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Repeated CREATE - INSERT - DROP operations tables could in some circumstances cause the MySQL table definition cache to become corrupt, so that some mysqld processes could access table information but others could not. (Bug#18595: http://bugs.mysql.com/18595)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: The mgm client command ALL CLUSTERLOG STATISTICS=15; had no effect. (Bug#20336: http://bugs.mysql.com/20336)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: TRUNCATE TABLE failed to reset the AUTO_INCREMENT counter. (Bug#18864: http://bugs.mysql.com/18864)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: SELECT ... FOR UPDATE failed to lock the selected rows. (Bug#18184: http://bugs.mysql.com/18184)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: The failure of a data node when preparing to commit a transaction (that is, while the node's status was CS_PREPARE_TO_COMMIT) could cause the failure of other cluster data nodes. (Bug#20185: http://bugs.mysql.com/20185)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Renaming a table in such a way as to move it to to a different database failed to move the table's indexes. (Bug#19967: http://bugs.mysql.com/19967)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Resources for unique indexes on Cluster table columns were incorrectly allocated, so that only one-fourth as many unique indexes as indicated by the value of UniqueHashIndexes could be created. (Bug#19623: http://bugs.mysql.com/19623)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Running ALL START in the NDB management client or restarting multiple nodes simultaneously could under some circumstances cause the cluster to crash. (Bug#19930: http://bugs.mysql.com/19930)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: SELECT statements with a BLOB or TEXT column in the selected column list and a WHERE condition including a primary key lookup on a VARCHAR primary key produced empty result sets. Note: This issue affected the 5.0 series of MySQL Cluster releases only. (Bug#19956: http://bugs.mysql.com/19956)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster (NDBAPI): On big-endian platforms, NdbOperation::write_attr() did not update 32-bit fields correctly. (Bug#19537: http://bugs.mysql.com/19537)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Some queries having a WHERE clause of the form c1=val1 OR c2 LIKE 'val2' were not evaluated correctly. (Bug # 17421)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Using "stale" mysqld .FRM files could cause a newly-restored cluster to fail. This situation could arise when restarting a MySQL Cluster using the --intial option while leaving connected mysqld processes running. (Bug#16875: http://bugs.mysql.com/16875)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Repeated use of the SHOW and ALL STATUS commands in the ndb_mgm client could cause the mgmd process to crash. (Bug#18591: http://bugs.mysql.com/18591)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: An issue with ndb_mgmd prevented more than 27 mysqld processes from connecting to a single cluster at one time. (Bug#17150: http://bugs.mysql.com/17150)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Data node failures could cause excessive CPU usage by ndb_mgmd. (Bug#13987: http://bugs.mysql.com/13987)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: TRUNCATE failed on tables having BLOB or TEXT columns with the error Lock wait timeout exceeded. (Bug#19201: http://bugs.mysql.com/19201)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Stopping multiple nodes could cause node failure handling not to be completed. (Bug#19039: http://bugs.mysql.com/19039)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: ndbd could sometimes fail to start with the error Node failure handling not completed following a graceful restart. (Bug#18550: http://bugs.mysql.com/18550)<br>
<br>
- NDB Cluster: Backups could fail for large clusters with many tables, where the number of tables approached MaxNoOfTables. (Bug#17607: http://bugs.mysql.com/17607)<br>
<br>
- On Windows, temporary tables containing `:' in the name could not be created. (Bug#20616: http://bugs.mysql.com/20616)<br>
<br>
- The --core-file-size option for mysqld_safe was effective only for root. (Bug#17353: http://bugs.mysql.com/17353)<br>
<br>
- Some queries that used ORDER BY and LIMIT performed quickly in MySQL 3.23, but slowly in MySQL 4.x/5.x due to an optimizer problem. (Bug#4981: http://bugs.mysql.com/4981)<br>
<br>
- mysql_upgrade was missing from binary MySQL distributions. (Bug#18516: http://bugs.mysql.com/18516, Bug#20403: http://bugs.mysql.com/20403)<br>
<br>
- Queries using an indexed column as the argument for the MIN() and MAX() functions following an ALTER TABLE .. DISABLE KEYS statement returned Got error 124 from storage engine until ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE KEYS was run on the table. (Bug#20357: http://bugs.mysql.com/20357)<br>
<br>
- A number of dependency issues in the RPM bench and test packages caused installation of these packages to fail. (Bug#20078: http://bugs.mysql.com/20078)<br>
<br>
- Nested natural joins worked executed correctly when executed as a non-prepared statement could fail with an Unknown column 'col_name' in 'field list' error when executed as a prepared statement, due to a name resolution problem. (Bug#15355: http://bugs.mysql.com/15355)<br>
<br>
- GROUP BY on an expression that contained a cast to DECIMAL produced an incorrect result. (Bug#19667: http://bugs.mysql.com/19667)<br>
<br>
- The max_length metadata value for columns created from CONCAT() could be incorrect when the collation of an argument differed from the collation of the CONCAT() itself. In some contexts such as UNION, this could lead to truncation of the column contents. (Bug#15962: http://bugs.mysql.com/15962)<br>
<br>
- The MD5() and SHA() functions treat their arguments as case-sensitive strings. But when they are compared, their arguments were compared as case-insensitive strings, which leads to two function calls with different arguments (and thus different results) compared as being identical. This can lead to a wrong decision made in the range optimizer and thus to an incorrect result set. (Bug#15351: http://bugs.mysql.com/15351)<br>
<br>
- For BOOLEAN mode full-text searches on non-indexed columns, NULL rows generated by a LEFT JOIN caused incorrect query results. (Bug#14708: http://bugs.mysql.com/14708)<br>
<br>
- BIT columns in a table could cause joins that use the table to fail. (Bug#18895: http://bugs.mysql.com/18895)<br>
<br>
- A UNION over more than 128 SELECT statements that use an aggregate function failed. (Bug#18175: http://bugs.mysql.com/18175)<br>
<br>
- InnoDB unlocked its data directory before committing a transaction, potentially resulting in non-recoverable tables if a server crash occurred before the commit. (Bug#19727: http://bugs.mysql.com/19727)<br>
<br>
- Multiple-table DELETE statements containing a subquery that selected from one of the tables being modified caused a server crash. (Bug#19225: http://bugs.mysql.com/19225)<br>
<br>
- With settings of read_buffer_size >= 2G and read_rnd_buffer_size >=2G, LOAD DATA INFILE failed with no error message or caused a server crash for files larger than 2GB. (Bug#12982: http://bugs.mysql.com/12982)<br>
<br>
- REPLACE statements caused activation of UPDATE triggers, not DELETE and INSERT triggers. (Bug#13479: http://bugs.mysql.com/13479)<br>
<br>
- The thread for INSERT DELAYED rows was maintaining a separate AUTO_INCREMENT counter, resulting in incorrect values being assigned if DELAYED and non-DELAYED inserts were mixed. (Bug#20195: http://bugs.mysql.com/20195)<br>
<br>
- mysqldump wrote an extra pair of DROP DATABASE and CREATE DATABASE statements if run with the --add-drop-database option and the database contained views. (Bug#17201: http://bugs.mysql.com/17201)<br>
<br>
- On 64-bit Windows systems, REGEXP for regular expressions with exactly 31 characters did not work. (Bug#19407: http://bugs.mysql.com/19407)<br>
<br>
- For mysqld, Valgrind revealed problems that were corrected: A dangling stack pointer being overwritten (Bug#20769: http://bugs.mysql.com/20769); possible uninitialized data in a string comparison (Bug#20783: http://bugs.mysql.com/20783); memory corruption in replication slaves when switching databases (Bug#19022: http://bugs.mysql.com/19022); syscall write parameter pointing to uninitialized byte (Bug#20579: http://bugs.mysql.com/20579).<br>
<br>
- For ndb_mgmd, Valgrind revealed problems that were corrected: A memory leak (Bug#19318: http://bugs.mysql.com/19318); a dependency on an uninitialized variable (Bug#20333: http://bugs.mysql.com/20333).<br>
<br>
- An update that used a join of a table to itself and modified the table on both sides of the join reported the table as crashed. (Bug#18036: http://bugs.mysql.com/18036)<br>
<br>
- SSL connections using yaSSL on OpenBSD could fail. (Bug#19191: http://bugs.mysql.com/19191)<br>
<br>
- On Windows, multiple clients simultaneously attempting to perform ALTER TABLE operations on an InnoDB table could deadlock. (Bug#17264: http://bugs.mysql.com/17264)<br>
<br>
- The fill_help_tables.sql file did not load properly if the ANSI_QUOTES SQL mode was enabled. (Bug#20542: http://bugs.mysql.com/20542)<br>
<br>
- The fill_help_tables.sql file did not contain a SET NAMES 'utf8' statement to indicate its encoding. This caused problems for some settings of the MySQL character set such as big5. (Bug#20551: http://bugs.mysql.com/20551)<br>
<br>
- The MySQL server startup script /etc/init.d/mysql (created from mysql.server) is now marked to ensure that the system services ypbind, nscd, ldap, and NTP are started first (if these are configured on the machine). (Bug#18810: http://bugs.mysql.com/18810)<br>
<br>
- MERGE tables did not work reliably with BIT columns. (Bug#19648: http://bugs.mysql.com/19648)<br>
<br>
- For a reference to a non-existent index in FORCE INDEX, the error message referred to a column, not an index. (Bug#17873: http://bugs.mysql.com/17873)<br>
<br>
- Some yaSSL public function names conflicted with those from OpenSSL, causing conflicts for applications that linked against both OpenSSL and a version of libmysqlclient that was built with yaSSL support. The yaSSL public functions now are renamed to avoid this conflict. (Bug#19575: http://bugs.mysql.com/19575)<br>
<br>
- CHECK TABLE temporarily cleared the AUTO_INCREMENT value. Because it runs with a read lock, other readers could perform concurrent inserts, and if so, they could get an incorrect AUTO_INCREMENT value. CHECK TABLE no longer modifies the AUTO_INCREMENT value. (Bug#19604: http://bugs.mysql.com/19604)<br>
<br>
- If there is a global read lock, CREATE DATABASE, RENAME DATABASE, and DROP DATABASE could deadlock. (Bug#19815: http://bugs.mysql.com/19815)<br>
<br>
- On Linux, libmysqlclient when compiled with yaSSL using the icc compiler had a spurious dependency on C++ libraries. (Bug#20119: http://bugs.mysql.com/20119)<br>
<br>
- Using CONCAT(@user_var, col_name), where col_name is a column in an INFORMATION_SCHEMA table, could cause erroneous duplication of data in the query result. (Bug#19599: http://bugs.mysql.com/19599)<br>
<br>
- Results from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA could contain uppercase information when lower_case_table_names was not 0. (Bug#17661: http://bugs.mysql.com/17661)<br>
<br>
- Grant table modifications sometimes did not refresh the in-memory tables if the hostname was '' or not specified. (Bug#16297: http://bugs.mysql.com/16297)<br>
<br>
- Invalid escape sequences in option files caused MySQL programs that read them to abort. (Bug#15328: http://bugs.mysql.com/15328)<br>
<br>
- InnoDB did not increment the handler_read_prev counter. (Bug#19542: http://bugs.mysql.com/19542)<br>
<br>
- Race conditions on certain platforms could cause the Instance Manager to fail to initialize. (Bug#19391: http://bugs.mysql.com/19391)<br>
<br>
- ALTER TABLE on a table created prior to 5.0.3 would cause table corruption if the ALTER TABLE did one of the following:    + Change the default value of a column.    + Change the table comment.    + Change the table password. (Bug#17001: http://bugs.mysql.com/17001)<br>
<br>
- An ALTER TABLE operation that does not need to copy data, when executed on a table created prior to MySQL 4.0.25, could result in a server crash for subsequent accesses to the table. (Bug#19192: http://bugs.mysql.com/19192)<br>
<br>
- The binary log lacked character set information for table name when dropping temporary tables. (Bug#14157: http://bugs.mysql.com/14157)<br>
<br>
- A B-TREE index on a MEMORY table erroneously reported duplicate entry error for multiple NULL values. (Bug#12873: http://bugs.mysql.com/12873)<br>
<br>
- Race conditions on certain platforms could cause the Instance Manager to try to restart the same instance multiple times. (Bug#18023: http://bugs.mysql.com/18023)<br>
<br>
- A CREATE TABLE statement that created a table from a materialized view did not inherit default values from the underlying table. (Bug#19089: http://bugs.mysql.com/19089)<br>
<br>
- The COM_STATISTICS command was changed in 5.0.3 to display session status variable values rather than global values. This causes mysqladmin status information not to be useful for the Slow queries and Opens values. Now COM_STATISTICS displays the global values for Slow queries and Opens. (Bug#18669: http://bugs.mysql.com/18669)<br>
<br>
- INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES provided inconsistent info about invalid views. This could cause server crashes or result in incorrect data being returned for queries that attempt to obtain information from INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables about views using stored functions. (Bug#18282: http://bugs.mysql.com/18282)<br>

<br>
- Several aspects of view privileges were being checked incorrectly. (Bug#18681: http://bugs.mysql.com/18681, Bug#20363: http://bugs.mysql.com/20363)<br>
<br>
- A view with a non-existent account in the DEFINER clause caused SHOW CREATE VIEW to fail. Now SHOW CREATE VIEW issues a warning instead. (Bug#20048: http://bugs.mysql.com/20048)<br>
<br>
- A bug in NTPL threads on Linux could result in a deadlock with FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK under some conditions. (Bug#20048: http://bugs.mysql.com/20048)<br>
<br>
- MyISAM table deadlock was possible if one thread issued a LOCK TABLES request for write locks and then an administrative statement such as OPTIMIZE TABLE, if between the two statements another client meanwhile issued a multiple-table SELECT for some of the locked tables. (Bug#16986: http://bugs.mysql.com/16986)<br>
<br>
- Subqueries that produced a BIGINT UNSIGNED value were being treated as returning a signed value. (Bug#19700: http://bugs.mysql.com/19700)<br>
<br>

<br>
- CREATE TABLE ... SELECT did not always produce the proper column default value in TRADITIONAL SQL mode. (Bug#17626: http://bugs.mysql.com/17626)<br>
<br>
- Privilege checking on the contents of the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS table was insufficiently restrictive. (Bug#16681: http://bugs.mysql.com/16681)<br>
<br>
- The result from CONV() is a string, but was not always treated the same way as a string when converted to a real value for an arithmetic operation. (Bug#13975: http://bugs.mysql.com/13975)<br>
<br>
- CREATE TABLE ... SELECT ... statements that used a stored function explicitly or implicitly (through a view) resulted in a Table not locked error. (Bug#12472: http://bugs.mysql.com/12472, Bug#15137: http://bugs.mysql.com/15137)<br>
<br>
- Within a trigger, SET used the SQL mode of the invoking statement, not the mode in effect at trigger creation time. (Bug#6951: http://bugs.mysql.com/6951)<br>
<br>
- The server no longer uses a signal handler for signal 0 because it could cause a crash on some platforms. (Bug#15869: http://bugs.mysql.com/15869)<br>
<br>
- Revised memory allocation for local objects within stored functions and triggers to avoid memory leak for repeated function or trigger invocation. (Bug#17260: http://bugs.mysql.com/17260)<br>
<br>
- EXPLAIN ... SELECT INTO caused the client to hang. (Bug#15463: http://bugs.mysql.com/15463)<br>
<br>
- Symlinking .mysql_history to /dev/null to suppress statement history saving by mysql did not work. (mysql deleted the symlink and recreated .mysql_history as a regular file, and then wrote history to it.) (Bug#16803: http://bugs.mysql.com/16803)<br>
<br>
- The basedir and tmpdir system variables could not be accessed via @@var_name syntax. (Bug#1039: http://bugs.mysql.com/1039)<br>

<br>
- For certain CREATE TABLE ... SELECT statements, the selected values were truncated when inserted into the new table. (Bug#17048: http://bugs.mysql.com/17048)<br>
<br>
- Use of uninitialized user variables in a subquery in the FROM clause results in bad entries in the binary log. (Bug#19136: http://bugs.mysql.com/19136)<br>
<br>
- In the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS table, the values for the CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH and CHARACTER_OCTET_LENGTH columns were incorrect for multi-byte character sets. (Bug#19236: http://bugs.mysql.com/19236)<br>
<br>
- An entry in the mysql.proc table with an empty routine name caused access to the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROUTINES table to crash the server. (Bug#18177: http://bugs.mysql.com/18177)<br>
<br>
- A range access optimizer heuristic was invalid, causing some queries to be much slower in MySQL 5.0 than in 4.0. (Bug#17379: http://bugs.mysql.com/17379, Bug#18940: http://bugs.mysql.com/18940)<br>
<br>
- IS_USED_LOCK() could return an incorrect connection identifier. (Bug#16501: http://bugs.mysql.com/16501)<br>
<br>
- mysql displayed NULL for strings that are empty or contain only spaces. (Bug#19564: http://bugs.mysql.com/19564)<br>
<br>

<br>
- mysql-test-run.pl started NDB even for test cases that didn't need it. (Bug#19083: http://bugs.mysql.com/19083)<br>
<br>
- SELECT DISTINCT queries sometimes returned only the last row. (Bug#18068: http://bugs.mysql.com/18068)<br>

<br>
- The binary log would create an incorrect DROP query when creating temporary tables during replication. (Bug#17263: http://bugs.mysql.com/17263)<br>
