MySQL 5.1.21-rc が公開されました！<br>
<br>
新機能満載の バージョン5.1系列の、RC版（リリース候補版)です。<br>
ようやくRC版にたどり着いたということで、正式リリースが近づいている様子が感じられ、わくわくしますね。<br>
前マイナーバージョン（5.1.20-beta)から1ヶ月強でのリリースということもあってか、修正点は少なめです。<br>

以下、チェンジログ<br>
<br>
■機能の追加と変更(5.1.22-rc)<br>
 - There is a new innodb_autoinc_lock_mode system variable to configure the locking behavior that InnoDB uses for generating auto-increment values. The default behavior now is slightly different from before, which involves a minor incompatibility for multiple-row inserts that specify an explicit value for the  auto-increment column in some but not all rows. This can be used to improve scalability and performance, see Section  13.5.6.3, "How AUTO_INCREMENT Handling Works in InnoDB.":<br>

<br>
<br>
■バグ修正(5.1.22-rc)<br>
 - NDB  Cluster:  Backups  of  TIMESTAMP  columns made with ndb_restore on a MySQL Cluster using data nodes hosts of one endian could not be used to restore the cluster's data to data node hosts of the other endian. (Bug#30134: http://bugs.mysql.com/30134)<br>
 <br>
 - NDB Cluster (Replication): Multi-master replication setups did not      handle      --log-slave-updates      correctly. (Bug#30017: http://bugs.mysql.com/30017)<br>
 <br>
 - When sorting rows in an INNODB table using a primary key, where the sort was on the the primary key column and the DESC operator was applied, the rows would be incorrectly sorted if you included a simple WHERE field = value clause in the query. (Bug#31001: http://bugs.mysql.com/31001)<br>
 <br>
 - Replication of InnoDB partitioned tables could lose updates with    row-based    or    mixed   replication   format. (Bug#28430: http://bugs.mysql.com/28430)<br>
 <br>
 - mysql_install_db  could  fail  to find its message file. (Bug#30678: http://bugs.mysql.com/30678)<br>
 <br>
 - Non-range  queries of the form SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE keypart_1=const, ..., keypart_n=const ORDER BY ... FOR UPDATE sometimes were unnecessarily blocked waiting for a lock if another transaction was using SELECT ... FOR UPDATE on the same table. (Bug#28570: http://bugs.mysql.com/28570)<br>
 <br>
 - Under some circumstances, a UDF initialization function could be      passed      incorrect      argument     lengths. (Bug#29804: http://bugs.mysql.com/29804)<br>
 <br>
 - CONNECTION_ID() always returned 0 for the embedded server (libmysqld). (Bug#30389: http://bugs.mysql.com/30389)<br>
 <br>
 - The  mysql_list_fields()  C API function incorrectly set MYSQL_FIELD::decimals    for    some    view    columns. (Bug#29306: http://bugs.mysql.com/29306)<br>
 <br>
 - Read lock requests that were blocked by a pending write lock request  were  not  allowed  to proceed if the statement requesting     the     write     lock     was    killed. (Bug#21281: http://bugs.mysql.com/21281)<br>
 <br>
 - Memory corruption occurred for some queries with a top-level OR operation in the WHERE condition if they contained equality predicates and other sargable predicates in disjunctive parts of the condition. (Bug#30396: http://bugs.mysql.com/30396)<br>
 <br>
 - The server created temporary tables for filesort operations in the working directory, not in the directory specified by the tmpdir system variable. (Bug#30287: http://bugs.mysql.com/30287)<br>
 <br>
 - Using KILL QUERY or KILL CONNECTION to kill a SELECT statement caused  a  server  crash if the query cache was enabled. (Bug#30201: http://bugs.mysql.com/30201)<br>
 <br>
 - Operations that used the time zone replicated the time zone only for successful operations, but did not replicate the time zone    for    errors    that    need    to   know   it. (Bug#29536: http://bugs.mysql.com/29536)<br>
 <br>
 - mysqldump from the MySQL 5.1.21 distribution could not be used to  create  a  dump from a MySQL 5.1.20 or older server. (Bug#30123: http://bugs.mysql.com/30123)<br>
 <br>
 - When using a combination of HANDLER... READ and DELETE on a table, MySQL continued to open new copies of the table every time, leading to an exhaustion of file descriptors. This was caused in MySQL 5.1.15 by a fix for Bug#21587: http://bugs.mysql.com/21587;  the current fix consists     of     reverting     the    earlier    fix. (Bug#29474: http://bugs.mysql.com/29474)<br>
 <br>
 - Tables  using  the  InnoDB  storage  engine  incremented AUTO_INCREMENT  values incorrectly with ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE. (Bug#28781: http://bugs.mysql.com/28781)<br>
